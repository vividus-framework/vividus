Reporting Security Issues and Vulnerabilities
=============================================

At VIVIDUS project we take security seriously. Whether it is the code we write or the dependencies we
use, security is always extremely important.

Please do not open an issue or pull request as this makes the problem immediately visible to everyone
including malicious actors.

Security issues in this project can be safely reported via the following address:

team@vividus.dev

In the report, please provide a [concise reproducible test case](http://sscce.org/) and describe
what results you are seeing and what results you expect.

Members of VIVIDUS project will be notified and will begin the triage process.
