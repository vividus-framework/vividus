# Contributing to Vividus
Thank you for considering a contribution to Vividus! This guide explains how to:

## Follow the Code of Conduct
Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Creating Commits And Writing Commit Messages

The commit messages that accompany your code changes are an important piece of documentation, please follow these guidelines when writing commit messages:

* Keep commits discrete: avoid including multiple unrelated changes in a single commit
* Keep commits self-contained: avoid spreading a single change across multiple commits. A single commit should make sense in isolation

## Pull requests

* Please create your pull request against the `master` branch. We will rebase/merge it to the maintenance branches, if necessary.
* We are using [Checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/), [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/), [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) to enforce a common code style. The check is integrated into the default build - so, make sure, you can build Vividus without errors.
* After you submit your pull request, a Vividus core developer will review it. It is normal that this takes several iterations, so don't get discouraged by change requests. They ensure the high quality that we all enjoy.

## Bug reports

We use the issue tracker on Github. Please report new bugs at <https://github.com/vividus-framework/vividus/issues/new/choose>.
