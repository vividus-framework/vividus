# Contributing to Vividus
Thank you for considering a contribution to Vividus! This guide explains how to:
* maximize the chance of your changes being accepted

* get help if you encounter trouble


## Follow the Code of Conduct
Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Creating Commits And Writing Commit Messages

The commit messages that accompany your code changes are an important piece of documentation, please follow these guidelines when writing commit messages:

* Keep commits discrete: avoid including multiple unrelated changes in a single commit
* Keep commits self-contained: avoid spreading a single change across multiple commits. A single commit should make sense in isolation

## Pull requests

* Please create your pull request against the `master` branch. We will rebase/merge it to the maintenance branches, if necessary.
* We are using [Checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/), [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/), [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) to enforce a common code style. The check is integrated into the default build - so, make sure, you can build Vividus without errors.
* After you submit your pull request, a Vividus core developer will review it. It is normal that this takes several iterations, so don't get discouraged by change requests. They ensure the high quality that we all enjoy.

## Coding Conventions
### Unit testing

* Business logic that is related to unit tests must not be placed within methods annotated with `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach` annotations, such methods can only be used for common logic such as initializing mock service for testing, clean up filesystem resources etc.

We use the issue tracker on Github. Please report new bugs at <https://github.com/vividus-framework/vividus/issues/new/choose>.
