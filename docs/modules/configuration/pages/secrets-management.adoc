= Secrets Management and Sensitive Data Protection

== Encryption

It is allowed to store property values and input test data in the encrypted form.
VIVIDUS uses Jasypt (Java Simplified Encryption) which provides two-way
encryption mechanism. While performing two-way encryption, apart from feeding
plain-text it's required to feed the secret text (i.e. password) and this secret
text is used to decrypt the encrypted text. The default encryption algorithm is
`PBEWithMD5AndDES`.

=== How to encrypt a string
==== Option 1 (Recommended): using Jasypt CLI

. Download the https://github.com/jasypt/jasypt/releases[latest Jasypt release]
. Unpack the downloaded zip-archive
. Go to `bin` folder
. Run the command performing encryption:
+
.Windows:
[source,bat]
----
encrypt.bat input="This is my message to be encrypted" password=paSSw0rd
----
+
.Linux/UNIX/macOS:
[source,shell]
----
./encrypt.sh input="This is my message to be encrypted" password=paSSw0rd
----
+
where
+
 - `input` - Any string to be encrypted.
 - `password` - Your encryption password.
+
NOTE: `paSSw0rd` is a sample password and should be never used, own strong password is required for the encryption.

. Find the encrypted data in `OUTPUT` section
+
.Encryption command output

==== Option 2: using https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/jasypt-online-encryption-decryption[Jasypt Online]

CAUTION: Use this tool at your own risk, since there is a chance of potential leakage of sensitive data

. Paste plain text string to encrypt to the corresponding text field.
. Set Type of Encryption to "Two Way Encryption (With Secret Text)".
. Enter secret key/text in the corresponding text field.
. Click "Encrypt".
. The resulting encrypted string can be copied from the corresponding field.

=== How to use an encrypted string

. Set the password in one of the following ways:
+
.. Set via OS environment variable `VIVIDUS_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD`
+
.. Pass the key with its password-value into a test run using command line:
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew runStories -Pvividus.encryptor.password=paSSw0rd
----
+
.. Add the password to the system project properties as the value of:
+
[source,properties]
----
system.vividus.encryptor.password=paSSw0rd
----
+
The encryption password is sought in the sequence provided above: first the OS environment variable, then the password
set via the command line, and finally the project system property. If the password is discovered at any point
in this sequence, the search stops, and additional options are not considered.
+
IMPORTANT: This password must be kept secret and must not be committed to version control system.
+
NOTE: `paSSw0rd` is a sample password and it should be never used, own strong password is required for the encryption.

. Use the encrypted value in the following ways:
+
.. Use the case-sensitive wrapping `ENC(...)` for any encrypted property value, e.g.:
+
[source,properties]
----
http.auth.password=ENC(7TQwyzsmuGSQ1GlUlPZVcrzY8BovTHWn1OuVaJ2PTdvOd3md25Y8szfXoHAq94Pw)
----
+
.. Decrypt the value with help of xref:commons:expressions.adoc#_decrypt[`decrypt` expression] and use the result in
test scenario, e.g.:
+
[source,gherkin]
----
When I enter `#{decrypt(ENC(7TQwyzsmuGSQ1GlUlPZVcrzY8BovTHWn1OuVaJ2PTdvOd3md25Y8szfXoHAq94Pw))}` in field located by `id(password)`
----

Please see xref:tests-configuration.adoc#_externalized_configuration[Externalized Configuration section] to get more
information on how encryptor password can be passed to the tests.

== Secrets Management Tools
=== https://www.vaultproject.io/[HashiCorp's Vault]
==== Configuration

Firstly, it is required to configure Vault endpoint and authentication method.

NOTE: The properties marked with *bold* are mandatory.

[cols="1,3,1", options="header"]
|===
|Property
|Description
|Example

|[subs=+quotes]`*vault.uri*`
|Vault endpoint
|`http://127.0.0.1:8200`

|[subs=+quotes]`*vault.token*`
a|Token authentication requires a static token to be provided.
[NOTE]
====
Token authentication is just one of several authentication methods that are https://docs.spring.io/spring-vault/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#vault.core.environment-vault-configuration[supported].
====
|`dev-only-token`

|`vault.namespace`
|Vault Enterprise allows using https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/namespaces[namespaces] to isolate multiple Vaults on a single Vault server. This feature is not supported by Vault Community edition and has no effect on Vault operations.
|`ns1/ns2`

|[subs=+quotes]`*secrets-manager.vault.enabled*`
|Defines whether VIVIDUS retrieves secrets from HashiCorp's Vault (`true` by default). If set to `false`, values from HashiCorp’s Vault will not be retrieved. Can be used when access to HashiCorp's Vault is restricted, e.g. for local debugging, to override only the required properties instead of all processed ones.
|`false`

|===

WARNING: `VAULT(...)` placeholder is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0, please use `HASHI_CORP_VAULT(...)` placeholder instead.

==== How to refer Vault secrets
. Find the required secrets in Vault.
+
image::vault.png[Secrets in Vault,width=70%]

. Build full paths to the secrets. For the secrets listed above, the paths would be `secret/vividus/test/username` and
`secret/vividus/test/password`.
. Put the built paths to properties using the case-sensitive wrapping `VAULT(...)`
+
[source,properties]
----
db.connection.test.username=HASHI_CORP_VAULT(secret/vividus/test/username)
db.connection.test.password=HASHI_CORP_VAULT(secret/vividus/test/password)
