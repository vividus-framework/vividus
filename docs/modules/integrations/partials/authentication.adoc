* If the authentication through basic schema is available on your JIRA instance use `jira.<jira instance key placeholder>.http.auth.username` and `jira.<jira instance key placeholder>.http.auth.password` properties, both properties must be set. It's also advisible to turn the `preemptive authentication` on.
