== Steps

=== Invoke AWS Lambda function

Invoke AWS Lambda function by providing the function name and the payload to pass to the Lambda function.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I invoke AWS Lambda function `$functionName` with payload `$payload` and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName`
----

* `$functionName` - The name of AWS Lambda function, version, or alias. The value can be retrieved by looking at the function in the AWS Console.
Supported name formats:
** Function name: `my-function` (name-only), `my-function:v1` (with alias).
** Function ARN: `arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function`.
** Partial ARN: `123456789012:function:my-function`.
+
It's allowed to append a version number or alias to any of the formats. The length constraint applies only to the full ARN.
If only the function name is specified, it is limited to 64 characters in length.
+
* `$payload` - The JSON that to provide to AWS Lambda function as input. Vividus performs a Base64 encoding on this field before sending this request to the AWS service. Users should not perform Base64 encoding on this field.
* `$scopes` - xref:commons:variables.adoc#_scopes[The comma-separated set of the variables scopes].
* `$variableName` - The variable name to store results. If the variable name is `my-var`, the following variables will be created:
** `${my-var.payload}` - the response from the function, or an error object
** `${my-var.status-code}` - the HTTP status code is in the 200 range for a successful request
** `${my-var.log-result}` - the last 4 KB of the execution log
** `${my-var.executed-version}` - the version of the function that executed, when it's invoked a function with an alias, this indicates which version the alias resolved to
** `${my-var.function-error}` - if present, indicates that an error occurred during function execution, details about the error are included in the response payload
