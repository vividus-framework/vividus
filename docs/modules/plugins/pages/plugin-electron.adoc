= Electron Plugin

The plugin provides the ability to test https://www.electronjs.org/[Electron]-based desktop applications.
VIVIDUS uses https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/automated-testing[ChromeDriver] functionality to interact with the application.

:plugin-short-name: electron
include::partial$plugin-installation.adoc[]

== Profile

The available profile is `desktop/electron`. It should be used together with `web/desktop/chrome`.

.configuration.properties
[source,properties]
----
configuration.profiles=desktop/electron,web/desktop/chrome

== Properties

NOTE: The properties marked with *bold* are mandatory.

[cols="6,3,2,6", options="header"]
|===
|Property Name
|Acceptable values
|Default
|Description

|*`electron-app.binary-path`*
|An absolute file path.
|
|The path to the executable file of the application under test.

|*`electron-app.chromium-version`*
|The version string, e.g. `102`
|
a|The chromium version used to build the application. The simplest way to determine the version is to run the tests without this property and then you should receive error message like this one:

TIP: Use major version e.g. `102.0`

|`electron-app.comamand-line-arguments`
|The space-separated list of arguments e.g. `--remote-debugging-port=9515 --user-dir=/Users/testtestius/temp`.
|<empty>
|The list of command line arguments for the application.

== Steps

In order to interact with the user interface one can use the steps from xref:plugins:plugin-web-app.adoc[Web Application Plugin].

=== Start application

Starts the application under tests.

[TIP]
====
Electron based applications may have one or more windows at the same time. Consider usage of the xref:plugins:plugin-web-app.adoc#_wait_for_window_and_switch[window waiting step] to manipulate with the windows during testing.

== How to debug electron-based applications

When you are writing tests for the electron based application you have few options to use DevTools. The first one relies on the embedded DevTools. The second option is to use https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/debugging/remote_debugger[remote DevTools debugging].
The simplest way is to start your application with `--remote-debugging-port=<port>` flag. Once the port is passed as an argument, DevTools will be available at `http://localhost:<port>`
