= REST API Plugin

The plugin provides the following abilities:

* build and send HTTP requests
* validate HTTP responses (headers, status code, body)
* validate JSON content of HTTP response bodies

== Expressions

NOTE: The expression parameters marked with *bold* are mandatory.

=== `removeWrappingDoubleQuotes`

WARNING: The expression is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0. Please use JSON steps validating and saving JSON element values instead

When REST API providing the data in JSON format is used it may be required to extract some values from JSON messages.
String values are usually wrapped into double quotes, but sometimes only the value without quotes is needed.
This expression allows to remove wrapping double quotes and use the value as is.

Actions performed by step:

* executes https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/HEAD[HTTP HEAD] request against the passed URL
* if the status code is `200` then the check is considered as `passed`
* if the status code falls under any of `404`, `405`, `501`, `503` then the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET[HTTP GET] request will be sent
* if the GET status code is `200` then check is considered as `passed`, otherwise `failed`
* if the target URL has already been checked then the check is considered as `skipped`

== HTTP cookie steps

=== Save value of HTTP cookie

Saves cookie to scope variable. If present several cookies with the same name will be saved cookie with the root path value (path is '/').

[source,gherkin]
----
When I save value of HTTP cookie with name `$cookieName` to $scopes variable `$variableName`
----

* `$cookieName` - The name of cookie.
* `$scopes` - xref:commons:variables.adoc#_scopes[The comma-separated set of the variables scopes].
* `$variableName` - The name of variable.

.Get cookie with name `cookieName` and save its value to scenario variable `value`
[source,gherkin]
----
When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/cookieName/cookieValue`
When I save value of HTTP cookie with name `cookieName` to scenario variable `value`
Then '${value}' is equal to 'cookieValue'
----

=== Change value of all HTTP cookies

Change cookie value. If several cookies with the same name exist in cookie store, the value will be changed for all of them.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I change value of all HTTP cookies with name `$cookieName` to `$newCookieValue`
----

* `$cookieName` - The name of cookie.
* `$newCookieValue` - The new value for `$cookieName`.

.Get cookie with name `cookieName` and set new value for it `newCookieValue`
[source,gherkin]
----
When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/cookieName/cookieValue`
When I change value of all HTTP cookies with name `cookieName` to `newCookieValue`
When I save value of HTTP cookie with name `cookieName` to scenario variable `value`
Then '${value}' is equal to 'newCookieValue'

== https://jwt.io/[JWT] steps

=== Generate JWT

Generates JSON Web Token (JWT) with header and payload signed with secret key using HmacSHA256 algorithm and saves the result to scope variable with the specified name.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I generate JWT with header `$header` and payload `$payload` signed with key `$key` using HS256 algorithm and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName`
----

* `$header` - The header of JWT.
* `$payload` - The payload of JWT.
* `$key` - Secret key used by HS256 algorithm to sign the token.
* `$scopes` - xref:commons:variables.adoc#_scopes[The comma-separated set of the variables scopes].
* `$variableName` - The name of variable to save the result.

.Generate JWT with specified payload and header signed with key `secretKey` using HS256 algorithm and save result to scenario variable `JWT`
[source,gherkin]

Given I initialize scenario variable `header` with value `{"typ":"JWT","alg":"HS256"}`
Given I initialize scenario variable `payload` with value `{"sub":"1234567890","name":"John Doe","admin":true,"jti":"c6859320-9fb3-4784-8c2f-1ab37044acfc","iat":#{toEpochSecond(#{generateDate(P, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss)})},"exp":#{toEpochSecond(#{generateDate(P1D, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss)})}}`

== Tips & Tricks

=== Validate HTTP response body

In order to validate the body of the latest HTTP response use the <<_http_response_as_text,response>> dynamic variable to access the body
data in conjunction with any step responsible for data validation like data comparison, JSON, XML and other steps.

.Validate response body
[source,gherkin]
----
When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/json`
Then JSON element from `${response}` by JSON path `$.slideshow` is equal to `
{
  "author": "Yours Truly",
  "date": "date of publication",
  "slides": [
    {
      "title": "Wake up to WonderWidgets!",
      "type": "all"
    },
    {
      "items": [
        "Why <em>WonderWidgets</em> are great",
        "Who <em>buys</em> WonderWidgets"
      ],
      "title": "Overview",
      "type": "all"
    }
  ],
  "title": "Sample Slide Show"
}
`
----

=== Save HTTP response body into variable

The HTTP response body can be saved into static variable by using the xref:commons:vividus-steps.adoc#_initialize_variable[init variable step]
in conjunction with the <<_http_response_as_text,response>> dynamic variable, it might be useful if you want to preserve the data for further computations since each
subsequent HTTP call rewrites previously received response data.
