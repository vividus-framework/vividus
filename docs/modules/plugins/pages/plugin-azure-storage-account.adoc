== Blob storage

=== Configuration

include::partial$azure-authentication.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

==== Endpoints

The blob storages endpoints are configured with the following property format:

[source,properties]
----
azure.storage-account.<key>.blob-service=<endpoint>
----

where:

. `key` - The logical key used to refer the storage account in the steps.
. `endpoint` - The blob service URL, e.g. `https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/`.
It's allowed to use blob service https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview[SAS] URL here,
in this case the authentication configuration is not required.

=== Steps

==== Retrieve the blob service properties

Retrieves the properties of a storage accountâ€™s Blob service and saves them as
JSON to a variable. For more information, see the
https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob-service-properties[Azure Docs].

|Filter
|Description
|Example value

|`blobNamePrefix`
|The prefix which blob names should start with.

|`blobNameFilterValue`
|The value to use by `blobNameFilterRule`. The filter is applied to the full blob name (including prefix specified in `blobNamePrefix`),
