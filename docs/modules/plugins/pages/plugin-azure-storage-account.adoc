:azure-service-name: storage-account

= Azure Storage Account Plugin

The plugin provides functionality to interact with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/[Azure Storage Account].

== Installation

.build.gradle
[source,gradle,subs="attributes+"]
----
implementation(group: 'org.vividus', name: 'vividus-plugin-azure-storage-account', version: '{current-version}')
----

== Common configuration

include::partial$azure-authentication.adoc[]

== Blob storage

=== Properties

The blob storages endpoints are configured with the following property format:

[source,properties]
----
azure.storage-account.<key>=<endpoint>
----

where:

. `key` - The logical key used to refer the blob storage in the steps.
. `endpoint` - The blob service URL, e.g. `https://mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/`.
It's allowed to use blob service https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview[SAS] URL here,
in this case the authentication configuration is not required.

=== Steps

==== Retrieve the blob service properties

Retrieves the properties of a storage accountâ€™s Blob service and saves them as
JSON to a variable. For more information, see the
https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob-service-properties[Azure Docs].
