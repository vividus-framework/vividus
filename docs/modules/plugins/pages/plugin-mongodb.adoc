= MongoDB Plugin

The plugin provides a functionality to interact with https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB].

:plugin-short-name: mongodb
include::partial$plugin-installation.adoc[]

== Properties

It's allowed to configure an unlimited number of MongoDB connections via the mechanism of the dynamic properties. The properties prefix example is:
```properties
mongodb.connection.my-mongodb-instance=mongodb+srv://username:password@mock-zzw4a.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
where `my-mongodb-instance` is a key used to refer a MongoDB connection in the steps. The key is defined by users, must be unique and can't contain dots.

== Steps

=== Execute database command

Executes a mongo database command against a mongo database and saves the command result to a variable

[NOTE]
====
* https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/[Database commands]
* For the `find` command the number of documents returned from the database is limited by the `batchSize` property that defaults to 101, so if you expect a dataset larger than the default value then adjust the `batchSize` property according to the number of expected documents

* `$command` - The database command to execute
* `$dbName` - The database name
* `$instanceKey` - The key of a particular connection under `mongodb.connection.` prefix
* `$scopes` - xref:commons:variables.adoc#_scopes[The comma-separated set of the variables scopes].
* `$variableName` - The variable name to store results in JSON format.

=== Execute chained commands

Executes an assembled sequence of predefined commands against a mongo database and saves the result to a variable
