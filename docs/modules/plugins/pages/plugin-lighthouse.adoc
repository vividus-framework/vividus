a|Lighthouse performance scores are changed due to inherent https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/variability[variability] in web and network technologies, even if there hasn't been a code change, to alleviate these effects this property allows to run several Lighthouse measurements and perform metrics validation on a measurement selected by user.

Available options:

* `HIGHEST` - validation is performed against Lighthouse measurement with the highest `performance score`, can be used only if `performance` category is specified in `lighthouse.categories` property.
* `LOWEST` - validation is performed against Lighthouse measurement with the lowest `performance score`, can be used only if `performance` category is specified in `lighthouse.categories` property.
* `NONE` - Lighthouse measurement is performed only once.

== Steps

=== Perform Lighthouse scan

Performs Lighthouse scan of the specified web page and validates performance metrics against expected thresholds.

=== Compare Lighthouse audit scores of two pages

Performs a Lighthouse scan on both the baseline and checkpoint pages validating that the audit scores of the checkpoint page have not worsened compared to the audit scores of the baseline page.
