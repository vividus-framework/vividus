=== Cross-account Access

Cross-account access is achieved https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-enable-cross-account-access-to-the-aws-management-console/[by switching roles]. Use the following property to specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume:

[source,properties]
----
aws.dynamodb.role-arn=
----

The property is empty by default: no role is assumed.

== Steps

:partiql: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference.html[PartiQL]

When I execute query `$partiqlQuery` against DynamoDB and save result as JSON to $scopes variable `$variableName`

* `$partiqlQuery` - The {partiql} (A SQL-Compatible Query Language for Amazon DynamoDB) query representing the `SELECT` statement to execute.
* `$scopes` - xref:commons:variables.adoc#_scopes[The comma-separated set of the variables scopes].
* `$variableName` - The variable name to store results in JSON format.
