== Steps

=== Run pipeline

Runs a pipeline in Data Factory, waits for its completion or until the timeout
is reached and validates the run status is equal to the expected one.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I run pipeline `$pipelineName` in Data Factory `$factoryName` from resource group `$resourceGroupName` with wait timeout `$waitTimeout` and expect run status to be equal to `$expectedPipelineRunStatus`
----

* `$pipelineName` - The name of the pipeline to run.
* `$factoryName` - The name of the factory.
* `$resourceGroupName` - The name of the resource group of the factory.
* `$waitTimeout` - The maximum duration of time to wait for the pipeline completion in {durations-format-link} format.
* `$expectedPipelineRunStatus` - The expected pipeline run status, e.g. `Succeeded`.

=== Run pipeline with parameters

Runs a pipeline with the provided input parameters in Data Factory, waits for
its completion or until the timeout is reached and validates the run status is
equal to the expected one.

----
When I run pipeline `$pipelineName` in Data Factory `$factoryName` from resource group `$resourceGroupName` with wait timeout `$waitTimeout` and with input parameters `$inputParametersJson` and expect run status to be equal to `$expectedPipelineRunStatus`
----

* `$pipelineName` - The name of the pipeline to run.
* `$factoryName` - The name of the factory.
* `$resourceGroupName` - The name of the resource group of the factory.
* `$waitTimeout` - The maximum duration of time to wait for the pipeline completion in {durations-format-link} format.
* `$inputParametersJson` - The input parameters of the pipeline run in JSON format.
* `$expectedPipelineRunStatus` - The expected pipeline run status, e.g. `Succeeded`.

}
` and expect run status to be equal to `Succeeded`

=== Collect pipeline runs

Collects pipeline runs in Data factory based on input filter conditions.

----
When I collect runs of pipeline `$pipelineName` filtered by:$filters in Data Factory `$factoryName` from resource group `$resourceGroupName` and save them as JSON to $scopes variable `$variableName`
----

* `$pipelineName` - The name of the pipeline to find runs.
* `$filters` - The xref:ROOT:glossary.adoc#_examplestable[ExamplesTable] with filters to be applied to the pipeline runs to limit the resulting set.
