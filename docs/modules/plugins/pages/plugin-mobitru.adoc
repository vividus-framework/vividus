== Profiles

The plugin defines profile with a set of the preconfigured properties. In order to simplify work with Mobitru the plugin does following steps:

. Waits for the requested device to be available using https://app.mobitru.com/wiki/api/#api-Device-TakeDeviceDesiredCapabilities[REST API call] and takes it in the usage.
. Installs application on the devices using https://app.mobitru.com/wiki/api/#api-InstallApp-InstallApp[REST API call].

IMPORTANT: For the device search plugin relies on the capabilities specified in the xref:plugins:plugin-mobile-app.adoc#_properties[properties].
