= Kafka Plugin

The plugin provides integration with an open-source distributed event streaming platform https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka].

== Installation

.build.gradle
[source,gradle,subs="attributes+"]
----
implementation(group: 'org.vividus', name: 'vividus-plugin-kafka', version: '{current-version}')
----

== Producer
=== Properties

NOTE: The properties marked with *bold* are mandatory.

[cols="4,2,1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Property Name
|Acceptable values
|Default
|Description

|[subs=+quotes]`*kafka.producer.bootstrap.servers*`
|`<host>:<port>`
|
|A comma-separated list of host and port pairs that are the addresses of the Kafka brokers in a "bootstrap" Kafka cluster that a Kafka client connects to initially to bootstrap itself.

|===

All other optional https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#producerconfigs[producer configs] can be set by prefixing regular Kafka properties with `kafka.producer.`.

=== Steps

==== *Send the data*

Sends the data to the provided topic with no key or partition.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I send data `$data` to Kafka topic `$topic`
----
* `$data` - the data to send
* `$topic` - the topic name

=== Examples

.Send the data to the Kafka topic
[source,gherkin]
----
When I send data `my-data` to Kafka topic `my-topic`

== Consumer
=== Properties

NOTE: The properties marked with *bold* are mandatory.

[cols="4,2,1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Property Name
|Acceptable values
|Default
|Description

|[subs=+quotes]`*kafka.consumer.bootstrap.servers*`
|`<host>:<port>`
|
|A comma-separated list of host and port pairs that are the addresses of the Kafka brokers in a "bootstrap" Kafka cluster that a Kafka client connects to initially to bootstrap itself.

|[subs=+quotes]`*kafka.consumer.group.id*`
|`<any-string>`
|
|A unique string that identifies the consumer group this consumer belongs to.

|===

All other optional https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs[consumer configs] can be set by prefixing regular Kafka properties with `kafka.consumer.`.

=== Steps

==== *Start the consumer*

Starts the Kafka consumer with the provided configuration to listen the specified topics. The consumer must be stopped when it's not needed.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I start consuming messages from Kafka topics `$topics`
----
* `$topics` - the comma-separated set of topics to listen

==== *Drain the consumed messages*

Drains the consumed messaged to the specified variable. If the consumer is not stopped, the new messages might arrive after the draining. If the consumer is stopped, all the messages received from the consumer start or after the last draining operation are stored to the variable.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I drain consumed Kafka messages to $scopes variable `$variableName`
----
* `$scopes` - xref:parameters:variable-scope.adoc[the comma-separated set of the variables scopes].
* `$variableName` - the variable name to store the messages. The messages are accessible via zero-based index, e.g. `${my-var[0]}` will return the first received message.

==== *Wait for the messages*

Waits until the count of the consumed messaged (from the consumer start or after the last draining operation) matches to the rule or until the timeout is exceeded.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I wait with `$timeout` timeout until count of consumed Kafka messages is $comparisonRule `$expectedCount`
----
* `$timeout` - the maximum time to wait for the messages in {iso-date-format-link} format
* `$comparisonRule` - xref:parameters:comparison-rule.adoc[the comparison rule]
* `$expectedCount` - the expected count of the messages to be matched by the rule

==== *Stop the consumer*

Stops the Kafka consumer started by the corresponding step before. All recorded messages are kept and can be drained into the variable using the step described above.

When I stop consuming messages from Kafka
----

=== Examples

.Consume messages from the Kafka topic
[source,gherkin]
----
When I start consuming messages from Kafka topics `my-topic-1, my-topic-2`
!-- Perform any actions triggering the publishing of messages to Kafka
When I wait with `PT30S` timeout until count of consumed Kafka messages is greater than `1`
When I stop consuming messages from Kafka
When I drain consumed Kafka messages to scenario variable `consumed-messages`
Then `${consumed-messages[0]}` is equal to `some-expected-message`
----

.Drain messages while listener is rinning
[source,gherkin]
----
When I start consuming messages from Kafka topics `my-topic-1, my-topic-2`
!-- Perform any actions triggering the publishing of messages to Kafka
When I drain consumed Kafka messages to scenario variable `messages-after-action-X`
!-- Perform more actions triggering the publishing of messages to Kafka
When I drain consumed Kafka messages to scenario variable `messages-after-action-Y`
When I stop consuming messages from Kafka
