= Web Application Plugin: Playwright Engine

The plugin provides functionality to interact with Web applications with help of https://playwright.dev/java/[Playwright] engine.

:plugin-short-name: web-app-playwright
include::partial$plugin-installation.adoc[]

== Profiles

The xref:configuration:tests-configuration.adoc#_profiles[profiles] allow to choose and/or parameterize browser that tests run on.

=== Desktop

The following profiles running desktop browsers are available out of the box:

- `web_pw/desktop/chromium` - for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, by default, Playwright uses open source https://playwright.dev/java/docs/browsers#chromium[Chromium] builds.
- `web_pw/desktop/firefox` - https://playwright.dev/java/docs/browsers#firefox[Playwright's Firefox] version matches the recent Firefox Stable build.
- `web_pw/desktop/webkit` - https://playwright.dev/java/docs/browsers#webkit[Playwright's WebKit] version matches the recent WebKit trunk build, before it is used in Apple Safari and other WebKit-based browsers.

=== Headless

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_browser[Headless mode] is a functionality that allows the execution of a full
version of the browser while controlling it programmatically. It can be used without dedicated graphics or display,
meaning that it runs without its “head”, the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The following profiles running browsers in
headless mode are available:

- `web_pw/headless/chromium` - for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and other Chromium-based browsers, by default, Playwright uses open source https://playwright.dev/java/docs/browsers#chromium[Chromium] builds.
- `web_pw/headless/firefox` - https://playwright.dev/java/docs/browsers#firefox[Playwright's Firefox] version matches the recent Firefox Stable build.
- `web_pw/headless/webkit` - https://playwright.dev/java/docs/browsers#webkit[Playwright's WebKit] version matches the recent WebKit trunk build, before it is used in Apple Safari and other WebKit-based browsers.

=== Request validation steps
:enable-recording-note: This step requires network recording to be turned on. It can be done in properties via "proxy.recording.enabled" or by switching on "@proxy" meta tag at the story or scenario level.

==== Capture HTTP message

Save the HTTP message part from the HTTP request with given URL-pattern into the variable with specified name and the scopes.

NOTE: {enable-recording-note}

The actions performed by the step:

* extract HTTP messages from the network recording archive
* find HTTP requests matching the provided HTTP methods and the URL regular expression
* check that total number of the found HTTP messages is equal to `1`
* save the HTTP message part to the specified variable

----
* `$httpMethods` - The comma-separated set of HTTP methods to filter by, e.g. `GET, POST, PUT`.
* `$urlPattern` - The regular expression to match HTTP request URL.
* `$httpMessagePart` - The HTTP message part to save. One of:
** `URL` - The request URL.
** `URL query` - The request URL query parameters.
** `request data` - The request data includes the following keys:
*** `query` - The URL query is stored as a collection of key and value pairs, where key is the name of the query parameter and value is the list of query parameter values. The query parameter values are accessible via zero-based index.
*** `resourceType` - The request's resource type as it was perceived by the rendering engine. `resourceType` will be one of the following: document, stylesheet, image, media, font, script, texttrack, xhr, fetch, eventsource, websocket, manifest, other.
*** `requestBody.contentType` - The MIME type of posted data.
*** `requestBody.text` - The posted data as plain text.
*** `responseStatus` - The response status.
** `response data` - The response data includes the following keys:
*** `responsetBody.contentType` - The MIME type of received data.
*** `responsetBody.text` - The received data as plain text.

.Validate the URL of the matching HTTP request
[source,gherkin]
----
Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus`
When I capture HTTP GET,POST request with URL pattern `.*/search.*=vividus` and save URL to scenario variable `URL`
Then `${URL}` is equal to `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus`
----

.Validate the URL query of the matching HTTP request
[source,gherkin]
----
Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus`
When I capture HTTP GET request with URL pattern `.*/search.*=vividus` and save URL query to scenario variable `query`
Then `${query.q[0]}` is equal to `vividus`
Then `${query.q}` is equal to `[vividus]`
Then `${query}` is equal to `{q=[vividus]}`
----

.Validate the request and response data from the matching HTTP messages
[source,gherkin,subs="attributes+"]
----
Given I am on page with URL `https://httpbingo.org/forms/post`
When I click on element located by `xpath(//input[@value='cheese'])`
When I click on element located by `xpath(//button)`
When I capture HTTP POST request with URL pattern `https://httpbingo\.org/post` and save request data to SCENARIO variable `requestData`
Then `${requestData.query}` is equal to `{}`
Then `${requestData.resourceType}` is equal to `document`
Then `${requestData.requestBody}` is not equal to `null`
Then `${requestData.responseStatus}` is equal to `200`
When I capture HTTP POST request with URL pattern `https://httpbingo\.org/post` and save response data to SCENARIO variable `responseData`
Then `${responseData.responseBody}` matches `.*"topping":.*"cheese".*`
----

==== Wait for the HTTP request

Waits for the HTTP requests matching the provided HTTP methods and URL regular expression.
If no HTTP request is sent and wait timeout is reached, then the step will fail.

NOTE: {enable-recording-note}

[source,gherkin]
----
When I wait until HTTP $httpMethods request with URL pattern `$urlPattern` is captured
----
* `$httpMethods` - The comma-separated HTTP methods to filter by, e.g. `GET,POST,PUT`.
