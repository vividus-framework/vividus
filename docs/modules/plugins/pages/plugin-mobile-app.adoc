== Steps

=== Start mobile application

Starts mobile application with capabilities from user's `*.properties` files and profiles set by a user.

[source,gherkin]
----
Given I start mobile application
----

=== Start mobile application with capabilities

Starts mobile application with capabilities from user's `*.properties` files and profiles set by a user.
Additionally the step takes a list of capabilities as an argument that overrides gloablly-defined capabilities.

[source,gherkin]
----
Given I start mobile application with capabilities:$capabilities
----

* `$capabilities` - The capabilities to start application with, these capabilies
have higher priority than capabilities defined in `*.properties` files and profiles.

.Start mobile application with 2 custom capabilities
[source,gherkin]
----
Given I start mobile application with capabilities:
|name                           |value|
|bstack:options.networkLogs     |true |
|appium:options.clearSystemFiles|false|
----


=== Activate mobile application

Activates the existing application on the device/emulator/simulator and moves
it to the foreground. The application should be already running in order to
activate it.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I activate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId`
----

* `$bundleId` - `Package name` for Android or `Bundle identifier` from `Plist.info` for iOS

.Switch to Safari browser application
[source,gherkin]
----
When I activate application with bundle identifier `com.apple.mobilesafari`
----


=== Reinstall mobile application

Removes the mobile application from device/emulator/simulator and installs it again.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I reinstall mobile application with bundle identifier `$bundleId`
----

* `$bundleId` - `Package name` for Android or `Bundle identifier` from `Plist.info` for iOS.

The key benefit is that instead of the full remote session recreation (which
includes device re-allocation in testing clouds, like SauceLabs, BrowserStack,
etc.) achivable via the following example:

[source,gherkin]
----
When I close mobile application
Given I start mobile application with capabilities:
|name     |value|
|fullReset|true |
----

the step re-uses the current session which significantly improves performance.

Terminates the running application on the device/emulator/simulator and
navigates to the home device screen. The remote session will not be closed.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I terminate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId`
----

* `$bundleId` - `Package name` for Android or `Bundle identifier` from `Plist.info` for iOS

=== Recording iOS Performance metrics

Records performance metrics of iOS application. It is based on the Instruments utility distributed by Xcode which provides a number of built-in analyses and measurements.
See https://appiumpro.com/editions/12-capturing-performance-data-for-native-ios-apps[Capturing Performance Data for Native iOS Apps] and https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/411/[Getting Started with Instruments] for more information.

[NOTE]
Appium server should be started with the *--relaxed-security* flag. This is because Instruments can gather data from the system as a whole, not just the AUT. (It's thus a security risk to expose potentially sensitive system information to Appium sessions running from a remote client).

[NOTE]
Archive with results contains *.trace file which could be opened by XCode. There is possibility to parse this file using XCode's utility https://keith.github.io/xcode-man-pages/xctrace.1.html[xctrace] and use generated data in tests
