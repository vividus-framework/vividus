== Profiles

=== iOS
:ios-profile: mobile_app/ios

The profile can be enabled by adding `{ios-profile}` to `configuration.profiles` property

Default profile configuration
[source,properties]
----

== Steps

=== Start mobile application

Starts mobile application with capabilities from user's `*.properties` files and profiles set by a user.

[source,gherkin]
----
Given I start mobile application
----

=== Start mobile application with capabilities

Starts mobile application with capabilities from user's `*.properties` files and profiles set by a user.
Additionally the step takes a list of capabilities as an argument that overrides globally-defined capabilities.

[source,gherkin]
----
Given I start mobile application with capabilities:$capabilities
----

* `$capabilities` - The capabilities to start application with, these capabilities
have higher priority than capabilities defined in `*.properties` files and profiles.

.Start mobile application with 2 custom capabilities
[source,gherkin]
----
Given I start mobile application with capabilities:
|name                           |value|
|bstack:options.networkLogs     |true |
|appium:options.clearSystemFiles|false|
----


=== Activate mobile application

Activates the existing application on the device/emulator/simulator and moves
it to the foreground. The application should be already running in order to
activate it.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I activate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId`
----

* `$bundleId` - `Package name` for Android or `Bundle identifier` from `Plist.info` for iOS

.Switch to Safari browser application
[source,gherkin]
----
When I activate application with bundle identifier `com.apple.mobilesafari`
----


=== Reinstall mobile application

Removes the mobile application from device/emulator/simulator and installs it again.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I reinstall mobile application with bundle identifier `$bundleId`
----

* `$bundleId` - `Package name` for Android or `Bundle identifier` from `Plist.info` for iOS.

The key benefit is that instead of the full remote session recreation (which
includes device re-allocation in testing clouds, like SauceLabs, BrowserStack,
etc.) achivable via the following example:

[source,gherkin]
----
When I close mobile application
Given I start mobile application with capabilities:
|name     |value|
|fullReset|true |
----

the step re-uses the current session which significantly improves performance.

[NOTE]
Appium server should be started with the *--relaxed-security* flag. This is because Instruments can gather data from the system as a whole, not just the AUT. (It's thus a security risk to expose potentially sensitive system information to Appium sessions running from a remote client).

[NOTE]
Archive with results contains *.trace file which could be opened by XCode. There is possibility to parse this file using XCode's utility https://keith.github.io/xcode-man-pages/xctrace.1.html[xctrace] and use generated data in tests

=== Set slider value

==== iOS

Sets the slider value in percents.

[WARNING]
* The accuracy of setting the slider value is not guaranteed and may vary depending on the device screen resolution.
* The target element must be of type `XCUIElementTypeSlider`.
* The percent number must be between 0 and 100 inclusively.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I set value of iOS slider located `$locator` to `$percent` percents
----

* `$locator` - The locator to find `XCUIElementTypeSlider` element.
* `$percent` - The target value of the slider in percents.

.Set value of iOS slider (with range 0:50) to 45

[source,gherkin]
----
When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `80` percents

==== Android

Sets the slider value to the number relatively to the slider leftmost side of its range.

[WARNING]
* The step is expected to set accurate value without deviations.
* The target element must be of type `android.widget.SeekBar`.
* The number must be greater than or equal to 0.
* Make sure the passed number does not exceed the right limit of the slider, this may lead to unexpected failure.
