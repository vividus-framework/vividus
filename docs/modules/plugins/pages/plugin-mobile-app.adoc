== Profiles

=== iOS
:ios-profile: mobile_app/ios

The profile can be enabled by adding `{ios-profile}` to `configuration.profiles` property

Default profile configuration
[source,properties]
----
selenium.grid.platform-name=iOS
selenium.grid.automation-name=XCUITest
----

=== Android
:android-profile: mobile_app/android

The profile can be enabled by adding `{android-profile}` to `configuration.profiles` property

Default profile configuration
[source,properties]
----
selenium.grid.platform-name=Android
selenium.grid.automation-name=UIAutomator2
----

=== BrowserStack

==== Info

* The profile can be enabled by adding `browserstack/mobile_app` to `configuration.profiles` property
* The profile must be used together with either `{ios-profile}` or `{android-profile}` profiles
* BrowserStack specific properties must be prepended with `selenium.grid.capabilities.bstack\:options.` prefix, meaning given a property `projectName` with a value `My Project` the resulting property will be `selenium.grid.capabilities.bstack\:options.projectName=My Project`
* Appium specific properties in BrowserStack must be prepended with `selenium.grid.capabilities.appium\:options.` prefix, meaning given a property `clearSystemFiles` with a value `true` the resulting property will be `selenium.grid.capabilities.appium\:options.clearSystemFiles=true`
* See https://www.browserstack.com/app-automate/capabilities?tag=w3c[Capabilities Builder] to setup configuration

==== Required properties
* `selenium.grid.device-name` - defines device name to run tests on


== Steps

=== Start mobile application

==== *_Info_*

Starts mobile application with capabilities from user's `*.properties` files and profiles set by a user

==== *_Wording_*

[source,gherkin]
----
Given I start mobile application
----

==== *_Usage_*

.Sample.story
[source,gherkin]
----
Scenario: Start mobile application
Given I start mobile application

=== Start mobile application with capabilities

==== *_Info_*

Starts mobile application with capabilities from user's `*.properties` files and profiles set by a user, additionally step takes list of capabilities as an argument that override previously defined capabilities

==== *_Wording_*

[source,gherkin]
----
Given I start mobile application with capabilities:$capabilities
----

==== *_Parameters_*

. `$capabilities` - capabilities to start application with, these capabilies have higher priority than capabilities defined in `*.properties` files and in profiles

==== *_Usage_*

.Sample.story
[source,gherkin]
----
Scenario: Start mobile application with capabilities
Given I start mobile application with capabilities:
|name                           |value|
|bstack:options.networkLogs     |true |
|appium:options.clearSystemFiles|false|
