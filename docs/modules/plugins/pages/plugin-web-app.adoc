@proxy - Some steps requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done via setting properties or switching on @proxy metatag.

== Steps

=== Clear proxy log

==== *_Info_*

Clears the proxy log

==== *_Wording_*

[source,gherkin]
----
When I clear proxy log

==== *_Usage_*

----
Scenario: Verify step When I clear proxy log
Given I am on a page with the URL 'http:/httpbin.org/get'
When I clear proxy log
Then number of HTTP GET requests with URL pattern `http://httpbin.org/get` is EQUAL TO `0`
----


=== Check if the number of requests with given URL-pattern exist

==== *_Info_*

{proxy}
Step gets proxies log, extract from contained requests URLs and match them with URL-pattern
If URLs are the same, there were calls with given URL-pattern, otherwise - weren't.
If there weren't any calls matching requirements, HAR file with all calls will be attached to report.
If response contains status code 302 - corresponding request will be filtered out.

==== *_Wording_*

[source,gherkin]
----
Then number of HTTP $httpMethod requests with URL pattern `$urlPattern` is $comparisonRule `$number`
----

==== *_Parameters_*

. `$httpMethod` - HTTP method to filter by
. `$urlPattern` - the string value of URL-pattern to filter by
. `$comparisonRule` - xref:parameters:comparison-rule.adoc[Comparison Rule]
. `$number` - The number to compare with

=== Saves the query string into the variable with specified name and scopes.

==== *_Info_*

{proxy}
Step gets proxies log, extract from contained requests URLs and match them with URL-pattern
If there is one entry, it saves the query string from request as Map of keys and values into the variable with specified name and scopes.
If there weren't any calls or more than one matching requirements, HAR file with all
calls will be attached to report.

==== *_Wording_*

----
When I capture HTTP $httpMethod request with URL pattern `$urlPattern` and save URL query to $scopes variable `$variableName`
----

==== *_Parameters_*

. `$httpMethod` - HTTP method to filter by
. `$urlPattern` - the string value of URL-pattern to filter by
. `$scopes` - xref:parameters:variable-scope.adoc[The set of variable's scope]
. `$variableName` - A variable name

Scenario: Verify step When I capture HTTP $httpMethod request with URL pattern `$urlPattern` and save URL query to $scopes variable `$variableName`
Given I am on a page with the URL 'http://httpbin.org/forms/post'
When I click on element located `By.xpath(//button)`
When I capture HTTP POST request with URL pattern `http://httpbin.org/post` and save URL query to SCENARIO variable `query`
Then `${query}` is equal to `{}`
