== Configuration

=== Authentication

The plugin will search for credentials using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default[the default credential provider chain] in the following order:

. Environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
. The properties: `system.aws.accessKeyId` and `system.aws.secretKey`.
. Web Identity Token credentials from the environment or container.
. In the default credentials file (the location of this file varies by platform).
. Credentials delivered through the Amazon EC2 container service if the `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` environment variable is set and security manager has permission to access the variable.
. In the _instance profile credentials_, which exist within the instance metadata associated with the IAM role for the EC2 instance. This step is available only when running your application on an Amazon EC2 instance, but provides the greatest ease of use and best security when working with Amazon EC2 instances.
. If the plugin still hasn’t found credentials by this point, client creation fails with an exception.

See the official https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default["Working with AWS Credentials"] guide to get more details.

=== Region Selection

The plugin will search for credentials using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/java-dg-region-selection.html#default-region-provider-chain[the default region provider chain] in the following order:

. Environment variable: `AWS_REGION`.
. The property: `system.aws.region`.
. AWS shared configuration file (usually located at `~/.aws/config`).
. Use the Amazon EC2 instance metadata service to determine the region of the currently running Amazon EC2 instance.
. If the plugin still hasn’t found a region by this point, client creation fails with an exception.

See the official https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/java-dg-region-selection.html["AWS Region Selection"] guide to get more details.
