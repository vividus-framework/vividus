=== Verify elements number

==== *_Info_*

Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches desired number

==== *_Wording_*

[source,gherkin]
----
Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity`
----

==== *_Parameters_*

. `$locator` - <<_locator>>
. `$comparisonRule` - xref:parameters:comparison-rule.adoc[Comparison rule]
. `$quantity` - expected number of elements

==== *_Usage_*

.VerifyNumber.story

----
Scenario: Step verification 'Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity`'
Then number of elements found by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5`

=== Verify elements state

==== *_Info_*

Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches number condition and all of them are in desired state

[IMPORTANT]

If you describe number condition as equal to 5 in case if there are 10 elements by this locator and only 5 of them in the desired state. You will get two failed assertions.
The first one about number condition violation. The second one about state check failure.

[WARNING]
In case when locator's visibility and checked state are equal (For an example :i and NOT_VISIBLE) exception will be thrown. In such cases please use step: <<_verify_elements_number>>

==== *_Wording_*

[source,gherkin]
----
Then number of $state elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity`
----

==== *_Parameters_*

. `$state` - xref:parameters:state.adoc[State]
. `$locator` - <<_locator>>
. `$comparisonRule` - xref:parameters:comparison-rule.adoc[Comparison rule]
. `$quantity` - expected number of elements

==== *_Usage_*

Scenario: Step verification 'Then number of $state elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity`'
Given I am on a page with the URL '${vividus-test-site-url}'
Then number of VISIBLE elements found by `tagName(img)` is = `1`
