=== Verify elements number

Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the desired number.

[source,gherkin]
----
Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity`
----

* `$locator` - <<_locator>>.
* `$comparisonRule` - xref:parameters:comparison-rule.adoc[The comparison rule].
* `$quantity` - The expected number of the elements.

.Verify the number of elements
[source,gherkin]
----
Then number of elements found by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5`
----


=== Verify elements state

Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the number
condition and all of them are in the desired state.

[IMPORTANT]
If you describe number condition as equal to 5 in case if there are 10 elements by this locator and only 5 of them in the desired state. You will get two failed assertions.
The first one about number condition violation. The second one about state check failure.

[WARNING]
In case when locator's visibility and checked state are equal (For an example :i and NOT_VISIBLE) exception will be thrown. In such cases please use step: <<_verify_elements_number>>

[source,gherkin]
----
