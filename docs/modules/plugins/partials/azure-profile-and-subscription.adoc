=== Azure environment selection

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-national-cloud[Azure environment]
could be optionally specified using either global property `azure.environment`
(sets the environment for all Azure plugins) or plugin-specific property
`azure.{azure-service-name}.environment`. The plugin-specific property takes
precedence over the global one. The default value is `AZURE`.

WARNING: The plugin-specific property `azure.{azure-service-name}.environment` is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.5.0. The global property must be used.

The supported environments are only:

- `AZURE`
- `AZURE_CHINA`
- `AZURE_GERMANY`
- `AZURE_US_GOVERNMENT`

=== Azure subscription selection

Azure subscription must be configured via `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment variable.
