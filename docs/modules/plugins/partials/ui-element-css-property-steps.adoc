=== Check an element CSS property

Checks the context element has the expected CSS property.

The context can be set by the <<_change_context,corresponding steps>>.

[NOTE]
====
If the comparison rule is `*IS_EQUAL_TO*` and both the actual and expected CSS values are colors in RGB or RGBA format (with an *alpha channel of 1* in RGBA [`rgba(r,g,b,1)`]), then both values are normalized to the RGB [`rgb(r,g,b)`] format before the comparison.

Normalization is *not performed* for other comparison rules or color representations.

When I change context to element located by `id(rainbow)`
Then context element has CSS property `<name>` with value that is equal to `<value>`
Examples:

|color                |rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)      |
|border-color         |rgb(0, 0, 0)          |
|background-color     |rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)      |
