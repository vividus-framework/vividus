=== Page steps

==== Open main application page

Loading the page which was associated with the main application page.

Main page can be set by the property `web-application.main-page-url` in the property file.

[source,gherkin]
----
Given I am on main application page
----

.Open page defined in the `web-application.main-page-url` variable
[source,gherkin]
----
Given I am on main application page
----

==== Open a page with defined URL

Loading the page with a given absolute URL, e.g. _https://example.com/_.

[source,gherkin]
----
Given I am on page with URL `$pageURL`
----

.Open 'https://docs.vividus.dev/' page
[source,gherkin]
----
Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/`
----

==== Open page with relative URL

Navigates the browser to the specific path in the current host defined in the _relative URL_ step parameter.

A relative URL can point to a file within a web site (like `about.html` or `/products`).

- If the parameter starts with '/' char, navigation will be performed from the root of the host, see examples below.
- If the parameter starts without '/' char or with './', navigation will be performed from the current path directory.

.Examples
|===
|Current page |Relative URL parameter|Opened page

|https://mysite.com
|about.html
|https://mysite.com/about.html

|https://mysite.com
|/products/new
|https://mysite.com/products/new

|https://mysite.com/path/foo
|stats
|https://mysite.com/path/foo/stats

|https://mysite.com/path/foo
|./docs/info.html
|https://mysite.com/path/foo/docs/info.html

|https://mysite.com/path/foo

----

==== Refresh the page

Refreshes the page: the step does the same as the reload button in the browser.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I refresh page
----

==== Validate the page title

Checks the page title matches to the text according to the provided string validation rule

[source,gherkin]
----
Then page title $comparisonRule `$text`
----

* `$comparisonRule` - string validation rule. One of:
** `is equal to` - title should be equal to `text`
** `contains` - title should contain `text`
** `does not contain` - title should not contain `text`
* `text` - the text of the title to compare

.Validate 'https://docs.vividus.dev/' page title
[source,gherkin]
----
Then page title is equal to `What is VIVIDUS :: VIVIDUS`
----

.Validate the part of 'https://docs.vividus.dev/' page title
[source,gherkin]
----
Then page title contains `VIVIDUS`
----

=== Click on element

Clicks on the element found by the specified locator.

The atomic actions performed are:

* find the element by the locator;
* click on the element if it is found, otherwise the whole step is failed and its execution stops;
* the first two actions are retried once if the field becomes stale during actions execution in other
words if https://www.selenium.dev/exceptions/#stale_element_reference[StaleElementReferenceException]
is occurred at any atomic action.

[NOTE]
====
If element by the specified locator is not clickable (overlapped by another element, problems with page/context loading or the element is disabled) the step will fail with corresponding error:
[source]
----
Could not click on the element: org.openqa.selenium.ElementClickInterceptedException: element click intercepted:
Element <a href="#where-to-buy" data-tab-name="..." role="button">Where to Buy</a> is not clickable at point (1619, 275).

.Validate Contact link is scrolled into view
[source,gherkin]
----
Then page is scrolled to element located by `xpath(//a[text()="Contact"])`
----

=== Text validation steps

==== Validate the text exists

Validates that the text is presented in the current context. Expected text is *case sensitive*.

The context can be set by the <<_change_context,corresponding steps>>. If no context is set, the text will be searched on the whole page.

[source,gherkin]
----
Then text `$text` exists
----
* `$text` - Expected text.

.Check the text 'Contract Us' is presented on the page
[source,gherkin]
----
Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/`
Then text `Contract Us` exists
----

==== Validate the text does not exists

Validates that the text is not presented in the current context.

The context can be set by the <<_change_context,corresponding steps>>. If no context is set, the text will be searched on the whole page.

==== Open URL in a new tab

Opens a new tab, switches the focus to this tab and loads the given URL.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The key difference of this step from the <<_open_a_new_tab,previous one opening a new tab>>
is that this step _inherits_ the state of the previous page, i.e.:

* new tab will have acces to the <<_web_storage_steps,session storage>> of the previous tab,
* it will be possible <<_close_current_tab_with_possibility_to_handle_alert,to handle alerts appearing on tab closing>>.

----

==== Close current tab with possibility to handle alert

Trying to close the current tab with '{onbeforeunload-event}' events handling.

* If an {popup-alert}[alert] window is opened via '{onbeforeunload-event}' event, it must be checked and handled in the subsequent steps.
* If an {popup-alert}[alert] window is not opened, the step closes the current window and switches to the previous window.

[TIP]
====
Windows/Unix and macOS platforms have different keyboards. For example, kbd:[Ctrl+C] combination is used to copy text
on Windows and Unix, but kbd:[⌘ Command+C] should be used on macOS with default preferences.

In order to close this gap VIVIDUS offers unique key `OS_INDEPENDENT_CONTROL`: it is mapped to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_key[`CONTROL`] key on Windows/Unix and to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_key[`COMMAND`] key on macOS. Using this key it is possible to make tests fully
platform independent.
