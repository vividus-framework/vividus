=== Mouse Actions
==== Click on the element

Clicks on the element found by the given locator.

The atomic actions performed are:

* find the element by the given locator;
* click on the element if it is found, otherwise the whole step is failed and its execution stops;
* the first two actions are retried once if the field becomes stale during actions execution in other
words if https://www.selenium.dev/exceptions/#stale_element_reference[StaleElementReferenceException]
is occurred at any atomic action.

[NOTE]
====
If the element by the given locator is not clickable (overlapped by another element, page or current context
is not loaded properly or the element is disabled) the step will fail with corresponding error:
[source]
----
Could not click on the element: org.openqa.selenium.ElementClickInterceptedException: element click intercepted:
Element <a href="#where-to-buy" data-tab-name="..." role="button">Where to Buy</a> is not clickable at point (1619, 275).
Other element would receive the click: <div class="content">...</div>
----
In this case extra steps might be needed to ensure element actionability, like, scrolling to the element, adding waits, etc.

Opens a new tab, switches the focus to this tab and loads the given URL.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The key difference of this step from the <<_open_a_new_tab,previous one opening a new tab>>
is that this step _inherits_ the state of the previous page, i.e.:

* new tab will have acces to the <<_web_storage_steps,session storage>> of the previous tab,
* it will be possible <<_close_current_tab_with_possibility_to_handle_alert,to handle alerts appearing on tab closing>>.

IMPORTANT: Handling {popup-alert}[alerts] displayed with '{onbeforeunload-event}' events is not implied by the WebDriver specification to {close-spec} window. For handling alerts use step based on JavaScript '<<_close_current_tab_with_possibility_to_handle_alert>>'.

NOTE: This step can only be applied to a session with multiple tabs open.

Trying to close the current tab with '{onbeforeunload-event}' events handling.

* If an {popup-alert}[alert] window is opened via '{onbeforeunload-event}' event, it must be checked and handled in the subsequent steps.
* If an {popup-alert}[alert] window is not opened, the step closes the current window and switches to the previous window.

NOTE: If you confirm window close in {popup-alert}[alert], the tab will be closed, and you will need to switch to current tab using the following step: `When I switch to tab with title that $stringComparisonRule `$windowName``.

[TIP]
====
Windows/Unix and macOS platforms have different keyboards. For example, kbd:[Ctrl+C] combination is used to copy text
on Windows and Unix, but kbd:[âŒ˜ Command+C] should be used on macOS with default preferences.

In order to close this gap VIVIDUS offers unique key `OS_INDEPENDENT_CONTROL`: it is mapped to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_key[`CONTROL`] key on Windows/Unix and to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_key[`COMMAND`] key on macOS. Using this key it is possible to make tests fully
platform independent.

=== Browser logs steps

This set of steps allows to validate the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console[browser console logging messages].

:log-levels: List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS.

In order to configure availability of the INFO level messages use following properties:
[cols="1,2"]
|===

|Browser
|Property to enable INFO logs

|Google Chrome
|`selenium.capabilities.goog\:loggingPrefs.browser=INFO`

|Microsoft Edge Chromium
|`selenium.capabilities.ms\:loggingPrefs.browser=INFO`

Waits for the appearance of the console log entries with the expected level and which match regular expression and saves all the entries (including awaited ones) of the expected level gathered during the wait to the scoped variable.

NOTE: Wait uses generic UI timeouts specified by the properties `ui.wait.timeout` and `ui.wait.polling-period`. See <<_properties>> section for more details.
