=== Resource validation logic

. If the `pages` row contains relative URL then it gets resolved against URL in `web-application.main-page-url` property, i.e. if the main page URL is `https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/` and relative URL is `/skyrim10` the resulting URL will be `https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/skyrim10`
. Collect elements by the CSS selector from each page
. Get either `href` or `src` attribute value from each element, if neither of the attributes exists the validation fails
. For each received value execute https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/HEAD[HEAD] request
.. If the status code is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200[200 OK] then the resource validation is considered as passed
.. If the status code is one of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404[404 Not Found], https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/405[405 Method Not Allowed], https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/501[501 Not Implemented], https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/503[503 Service Unavailable] then GET request will be executed
.. If the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET[GET] status code is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200[200 OK] then the resource validation is considered as passed, otherwise failed
