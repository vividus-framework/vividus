=== Context element rectangle

The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access context element
coordinates, width and height.

IMPORTANT: The variables rely on the contextual approach: it is necessary to switch context to the target element.

WARNING: In case of missing search context the error will be logged and `-1` will be returned as a result
