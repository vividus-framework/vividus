=== Proxy Steps
==== Check the number of HTTP requests
:proxy: This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level.
:har-attached: In case of failure the full HTTP archive (HAR) is attached to the report.

{proxy}

The actions preformed by the step:

* extract HTTP messages from the recorded proxy archive
* filter out the HTTP messages with the response status code `302 Moved Temporarily`
* find HTTP requests matching the provided HTTP methods and the URL regular expression
* check that the total number of the found HTTP messages satisfies the desired condition

{har-attached}

[source,gherkin]
----
Then number of HTTP $httpMethods requests with URL pattern `$urlPattern` is $comparisonRule `$number`
----
* `$httpMethods` - The comma-separated HTTP methods to filter by
* `$urlPattern` - The regular expression to match HTTP request URL
* `$comparisonRule` - xref:parameters:comparison-rule.adoc[Comparison Rule]
* `$number` - The number to compare with

.Check the number of HTTP GET and POST requests matching URL regular expression is equal to 1
[source,gherkin]
----
Then number of HTTP GET, POST requests with URL pattern `http://httpbin\.org/get` is equal to `1`

==== Capture HTTP message

Save the HTTP message part from the HTTP request with given URL-pattern into the variable with specified name and the scopes.

** `URL` - The request URL.
** `URL query` - The request URL query parameters.
** `request data` - The request data includes the following keys:
*** `query` - The URL query is stored as a collection of key and value pairs, where key is the name of the query parameter and value is the list of query parameter values. The query parameter values are accessible via zero-based index.
*** `requestBody.mimeType` - The MIME type of posted data, the variable will not be saved if MIME type is not present.
*** `requestBody.text` - The posted data as plain text, the variable will not be saved if the request body is not present.
*** `requestBodyParameters` - The form data parameters are stored as a collection of key and value pairs, where key is the name of the form parameter and value is the list of form parameter values. The form parameter values are accessible via zero-based index.
*** `responseStatus` - The response status, the variable will not be saved if the response is not present.
** `response data` - The response data includes the following keys:
*** `responseBody.mimeType` - The MIME type of response data, the variable will not be saved if MIME type is not present.
*** `responseBody.text` - The response data as plain text, the variable will not be saved if the response body is not present.
