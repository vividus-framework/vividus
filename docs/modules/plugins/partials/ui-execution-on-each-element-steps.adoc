=== Perform steps for each found element

Executes the steps against all elements found by locator. After a required number of elements is found,
search context switches in order for each found element and performs all steps on it.

[IMPORTANT]
If comparison rule mismatch steps will not be performed even if elements are found.

When I find = `5` elements by `xpath(//script):a` and for each element do
|step                                                                                      |
