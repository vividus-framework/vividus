=== Treat known issues only as a positive result

Any known issues detected during stories run fail the overall execution with the corresponding
xref:ROOT:tests-configuration.adoc#_exit_codes[exit code]. The following command-line option can be used to not treat
known issues as failures:

.Enable treating of known issues as a positive result for current stories run
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
./gradlew {task-name} --treat-known-issues-only-as-passed
----

The treating of known issues as a positive result can be enabled globally at the project level by adding the following
line into the `build.gradle` file of the tests project:

.Enable treating of known issues as positive result for stories exeuctions at the project level

Writing of the exit code can be enabled globally using project properties:

.Write exit code to a file by an absolute path via CLI

----
./gradlew {task-name} -PfileToSaveExitCode='/user/dir/exitCode.txt'
----

.Write an exit code to a file with a path related to the project build directory via CLI
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
./gradlew {task-name} -PfileToSaveExitCode='/exitCode.txt' -PresolvePathAgainstProjectBuildDir=true
----

Writing of the exit code can be enabled globally for the project by adding the following lines into the
`build.gradle` file of the test project:

.Write the exit code to a file by an absolute path via the project property
[source,gradle,subs="attributes+"]
----
{task-name}.fileToSaveExitCode ='/user/dir/exitCode.txt'
----

.Write an exit code to file with a path related to the project build directory via project property
