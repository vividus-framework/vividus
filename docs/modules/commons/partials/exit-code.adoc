=== Write exit code to a file

Writing of the exit code can be enabled globally using project properties:

.Write exit code to a file by an absolute path via CLI
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
./gradlew {task-name} -PfileToSaveExitCode='/user/dir/exitCode.txt'
----

.Write an exit code to a file with a path related to the project build directory via CLI
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
./gradlew {task-name} -PfileToSaveExitCode='/exitCode.txt' -PresolvePathAgainstProjectBuildDir=true
----

Writing of the exit code can be enabled globally for the project by adding the following lines into the
`build.gradle` file of the test project:

.Write the exit code to a file by an absolute path via the project property
[source,gradle,subs="attributes+"]
----
{task-name}.fileToSaveExitCoded ='/user/dir/exitCode.txt'
----

.Write an exit code to file with a path related to the project build directory via project property
[source,gradle,subs="attributes+"]
----
{task-name}.fileToSaveExitCoded = '/exitCode.txt'
{task-name}.resolvePathAgainstProjectBuildDir = true
----
