Scenario: Click button 5 times
Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://vividus-test-site.herokuapp.com/mouseEvents.html'
When I execute steps at most 5 times while variable `var` is < `3`:
|step                                                                                                                   |
|When I click on element located `id(counter)`                                                                          |
|When I find <= `1` elements by `xpath(//div[@id='clickResult' and (text()='3' or text()='4')])` and for each element do|
|{headerSeparator=!,valueSeparator=!}                                                                                   |
|!step!                                                                                                                 |
|!When I set the text found in search context to the 'scenario' variable 'var'!                                         |
Then `${var}` is = `3`
