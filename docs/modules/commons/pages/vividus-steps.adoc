=== Initialize variable using template

Initializes a variable with a result of the processed https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/dgui_template_overallstructure.html[Freemarker template]

Set the `template-processor.resolve-bdd-variables` property to `true` value to be able to use `global`, `next batches`, `scenario` and `story` variables within templates. The variables can be referred using the variable reference notation. Note that the parameters passed to the step take precedence over the variables.

The vividus expressions can be used within templates by using `${execVividusExpression('expression name', args)}` syntax. It's also allowed to use nested expressions by using the following syntax `${execVividusExpression('expression name', arg1, execVividusExpression('expression name', args))}`.

[source,gherkin]
----
Given I initialize the $scopes variable `$variableName` using template `$templatePath` with parameters:$templateParameters
----

* `$scopes` - xref:commons:variables.adoc#_scopes[The comma-separated set of the variables scopes].
* `$variableName` - The variable name to store a result.
* `$templatePath` - The relative to `src/main/resources` path to a template.
* `$templateParameters` - The template parameters.

.Personal info template at templates/person.ftl
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": ${execVividusExpression('randomInt', 1, 10)},
  "postalCode": ${execVividusExpression('generate', "Number.digits '6'")},
  "hash": "${execVividusExpression('encodeToBase64', execVividusExpression('randomInt', 100, 1000))}",
  "name": "${name[0]}",
  "race": "${race[0]}",
  "age": ${age}
}
----

.Generate JSON from the personal info template
[source,gherkin]
----
When I initialize the scenario variable `age` with value `4510`
Given I initialize the scenario variable `personalInfo` using template `templates/person.ftl` with parameters:
|name     |race  |
|Dagoth Ur|Dunmer|
----

=== Assert the value matches regex

Asserts that the given value matches the specified regular expression.
The dotall mode is enabled by default: the expression `.` matches any character,
including a line terminator.

[source,gherkin]
----
Then `$value` matches `$regex`
----

* `$value` - The value to assert.
* `$regex` - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression[The regular expression].

=== Create a file

Saves the provided content to a file with the specified file path.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I create file with content `$fileContent` at path `$filePath`
----

* `$fileContent` - The content to be saved to the creating file.
* `$filePath` - The fully qualified file name including parent folders and extension (e.g. `temp/some_file.txt`).


=== Create a temporary file

Creates a temporary file with the provided content and puts its path to a variable with the specified name.
The created file will be removed upon test run completion.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I create temporary file with name `$name` and content `$content` and put path to $scopes variable `$variableName`
----

* `$name` - The logical name of the creating temporary file. For example, when `$name` is equal to `my-file.txt`, then `my-file` will be used as a prefix in the temporary file name and `.txt` - as a suffix.
* `$content` - The content to be saved to the creating temporary file.
* `$scopes` - xref:commons:variables.adoc#_scopes[The comma-separated set of the variables scopes].
* `$variableName` - The name of the variable to store the full path of the created temporary file.

If you want to use the created temporary file in further batches of the test suite as an input data, you should use https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8089#appendix-A[URL with `file` protocol]

.Batch 1 - Create a temporary local file
[source,gherkin]
----
When I create temporary file with name `.table` and content `
|column|
|value |
` and put path to NEXT_BATCHES variable `examples-table-temporary-file`
----

.Batch 2 - Use the temporary file as xref:ROOT:glossary.adoc#_examplestable[ExamplesTable]
[source,gherkin]
----
Then `<column>` is equal to `value`
Examples:
file:///${examples-table-temporary-file}
----


=== Compare variables

Compare the value from the first *variable* with the value from the second *variable* in accordance with the *condition*. Could compare Maps and Lists of maps using EQUAL_TO comparison rule.
Other rules will fallback to strings comparison.

INFO: The step prints the comparison results in the unified diff format for the strings with the legth more than specified in the property xref:ROOT:tests-configuration.adoc#_configuration_properties[report.text-length-diff-threshold].

WARNING: If the variables contain valid numbers than they will be converted into https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/math/BigInteger.html[BigInteger] and compared as numbers.

[source,gherkin]
----
Then `$variable1` is $comaprisonRule `$variable2`
----

* `$variable1` - The first variable.
* `$comparisonRule` - xref:parameters:comparison-rule.adoc[The comparison rule].
* `$variable1` - The second variable.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I execute SQL query `SELECT * FROM test.launch_rockets WHERE name='Proton'` against `preprod` and save result to scenario variable `preprod-date`
When I execute SQL query `SELECT * FROM test.launch_rockets WHERE name='Proton'` against `prod` and save result to scenario variable `prod-data`
Then `${preprod-data}` is = `${prod-data}`
----

=== Execute steps N times

Step is designed to execute specified steps while counter with a certain limit matches a comparison rule. On each iteration the counter is increased on specified value, which is allowed to be either positive or negative. The seed value is used as a starting point for iteration. Current iteration index is available within steps to execute as `$\{iterationVariable}`.

[source,gherkin]
----
When I execute steps while counter is $comparisonRule `$limit` with increment `$increment` starting from `$seed`:$stepsToExecute
----

Alias:
[source,gherkin]
----
When I execute steps while counter is $comparisonRule '$limit' with increment '$increment' starting from '$seed':$stepsToExecute
----

* `$comparisonRule` - xref:parameters:comparison-rule.adoc[The comparison rule].
* `$limit` - The counter limit.
* `$increment` - The number to add to the counter on each iteration.
* `$seed` - The initial counter value.
* `$stepsToExecute` - The xref:ROOT:glossary.adoc#_examplestable[ExamplesTable] with a single column `step` containing the steps to execute.
