In scope of this article the `task` term is a piece of work that is done on stories, scenarios, steps and other entities
and that produces some output based on the work done.

.The format of a task

NOTE: The tasks are available only through the `gradlew` command.

== Run stories

The task runs test stories based on current xref:configuration:tests-configuration.adoc[tests configuration] and tests state
on the file system:

:task-name: runStories
include::partial$stories-exec.adoc[]

== Debug stories

The task runs test stories omitting VIVIDUS initialization check based on current xref:configuration:tests-configuration.adoc[tests configuration]
and tests state on the file system.

:task-name: debugStories
include::partial$stories-exec.adoc[]

== Print available steps

The task prints all the steps that are available for the xref:configuration:tests-configuration.adoc[configured] profiles, environments and suites in the alphabetical order.

== Replace deprecated steps

The task replaces deprecated steps with actual ones in all stories(`\*.story` files) and composite steps (`*.steps` files) along the path `<project-name>/src/main/resources`.
Please note that some deprecated steps (for example which should be replaced with two steps) cannot be replaced automatically and must be refactored manually.

[tabs]
======
macOS / Linux::
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew replaceDeprecatedSteps
----

Windows::
+
[source,shell]
----
gradlew replaceDeprecatedSteps
----
======

.Output (for cases when found steps which cannot be replaced automatically)
[source]
----
The step "When I check all checkboxes located by `xpath(.//input)`" from "CheckboxStepsTests.story - Scenario: Validation of step 'When I $checkboxState all checkboxes located by `$checkboxesLocator`'" is deprecated but cannot be replaced automatically, please replace it manually.
The step "When I check all checkboxes located by `xpath(.//input)`" from "composite.steps - Composite: When I run composite step with table:$table" is deprecated but cannot be replaced automatically, please replace it manually.
----

== Replace deprecated properties

The task replaces deprecated properties with actual ones in all properties files along the path `<project-name>/src/main/resources/properties`.

[tabs]
======
macOS / Linux::
+
[source,shell]

./gradlew replaceDeprecatedProperties

gradlew replaceDeprecatedProperties

The examples below demonstrate property file with deprecated properties before and after applying the `replaceDeprecatedProperties` task.

== Find and fix formatting issues
https://github.com/diffplug/spotless[Spotless] checks refer to formatting and linting validations to enforce consistent
code quality standards. Spotless automates the formatting of files based on predefined rules and integrates with linting
tools. It offers a number of generic formatters (indentation correction, normalize line endings, enforce consistent EOF
files, enforce file encoding, etc.) that help keep test files clean, readable, and consistent, reducing noise in version
control and making collaboration easier.

For files like `*.story`, `*.steps`, `*.table`, commonly used in VIVIDUS, the following Spotless rules are applied by default:

.Spotless rules
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Rule
|Description

|Trimming Trailing Whitespace
|Removes any spaces or tabs at the end of lines.

|Ensuring Newline at End of File
|Guarantees that each file ends with a single newline.

|Consistent Indentation
|Enforces 4 spaces for indentation.

|Normalizing Line Endings
|Converts all line endings to LF (\n) for consistency across platforms.

|===

=== Spotless tasks

The task validates that all files comply with the specified formatting rules.

NOTE: This task is executed automatically during the build process and does not require manual invocation.

[tabs]
======
macOS / Linux::
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew spotlessCheck
----

Windows::
+
[source,shell]
----
gradlew spotlessCheck
----
======

The task automatically formats files to conform to the defined rules.

[tabs]
======
macOS / Linux::
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew spotlessApply
----

Windows::
+
[source,shell]
----
gradlew spotlessApply
----
======

=== Fixing Spotless violations

If the `build` task is failed and the result like the following is shown in the console output, it means that some files
do not comply with the Spotless rules.

[source,shell]
----

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':spotlessVividusCheck'.

  Run './gradlew :spotlessApply' to fix these violations.
----

You can fix the violations manually or automatically by running the `spotlessApply` task. After fixing, review
the changes and commit them to your repository. Following these steps will help keep your build stable and successful.
