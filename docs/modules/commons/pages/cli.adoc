In scope of this article the `task` term is a piece of work that is done on stories, scenarios, steps and other entities
and that produces some output based on the work done.

.The format of a task
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew <task to perform>
----

.The format of a task with arguments
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew <task to perform> --args='<arguments to pass into the task>'
----

NOTE: The tasks are available only through the `gradlew` command.

== Run stories

The task runs test stories based on current xref:ROOT:tests-configuration.adoc[tests configuration] and tests state
on the file system.

.macOS / Linux:
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew runStories
----

.Windows:
[source,shell]
----
gradlew runStories
----

Known issues occurred during stories run fail the overall test execution with the corresponding xref:ROOT:tests-configuration.adoc#_exit_codes[exit code] by default. Use the following property in order to not treat known issues as failures:

.Enable treating of known issues as positive result for current stories run
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew runStories -PtreatKnownIssuesOnlyAsPassed=true
----

The treating of known issues as passed can be enabled globally for project by adding the following line into the
`build.gradle` file of the tests project:

.Enable treating of known issues as positive result for stories runs at project level
[source,gradle]
----
runStories.treatKnownIssuesOnlyAsPassed = true
----

== Debug stories

The task runs test stories omitting VIVIDUS initialization check based on current xref:ROOT:tests-configuration.adoc[tests configuration]
and tests state on the file system.

.macOS / Linux:
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew debugStories
----

.Windows:
[source,shell]
----
gradlew debugStories
----

Known issues occurred during stories run fail the overall test execution with the corresponding xref:ROOT:tests-configuration.adoc#_exit_codes[exit code] by default. Use the following property in order to not treat known issues as failures:

.Enable treating of known issues as positive result for current debug run
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew debugStories -PtreatKnownIssuesOnlyAsPassed=true
----

The treating of known issues as passed can be enabled globally for project by adding the following line into the
`build.gradle` file of the tests project:

.Enable treating of known issues as positive result for debug runs at project level
[source,gradle]
----
debugStories.treatKnownIssuesOnlyAsPassed = true
----

== Print available steps

The task prints all the steps that are available for the xref:ROOT:tests-configuration.adoc[configured] profiles, environments and suites in the alphabetical order.

.Options

|Description
|Short notation

vividus-plugin-web-app                              When I switch back to the page
vividus-plugin-web-app                              When I press $keys on keyboard
                            COMPOSITE IN STEPS FILE Then an element with the name '$elementName' exists
                            COMPOSITE IN STEPS FILE When I click on an image with the name '$imageName'

== Count steps

The task counts steps in the specified tests folder and prints them in the descending order.

.macOS / Linux:
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew countSteps --args='-t 5 -d story/uat'
----

.Windows:
[source,shell]

gradlew countSteps --args='-t 5 -d story/uat'
----

.Output

Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity`                             110
Given I initialize $scopes variable `$variableName` with value `$variableValue`                         83
When I change context to element located `$locator`                                                     59
