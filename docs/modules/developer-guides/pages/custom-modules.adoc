= Custom Modules

Custom modules are extensible and flexible mechanism for development and represent project-specific
logic (steps, transformers, expressions, etc.). The custom modules may depend on extensions and/or plugins,
may not have dependencies at all, also they may override default behaviour of plugins and extensions if needed,
but note that overriding of behaviour of other custom modules can yield undetermenistic behaviours.
