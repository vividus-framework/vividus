= Extension points

VIVIDUS functionality can be extended with custom business logic. It could be
done either in separate modules included then as dependencies, or in Gradle
sub-projects belonging to the root test project, or in the test project directly.
VIVIDUS defines API-s and conventions that must be followed while implementing
custom extensions.
