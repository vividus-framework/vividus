= What is VIVIDUS

VIVIDUS is a test automation tool that offers already implemented solution for testing of most popular application types.

== Introduction

A target user of VIVIDUS is a test engineer without programming skills but some technical knowledge to allocate and specify controls and elements of the application to VIVIDUS (or any other application substances as DB/API dataset or UI visual objects). VIVIDUS provides a ready-to-use implemented language to write executable tests, it's named - Test Actions Language. Test Actions Language is human-readable and written in Gherkin format to ensure the clarity of it to users of any technical level; on the other hand Test Actions Language is not limited to any specific application or domain as itâ€™s commonly done in classical BDD approach.
