== Introduction

A target user of VIVIDUS is a test engineer without programming skills but some technical knowledge to allocate and specify controls and elements of the application to VIVIDUS (or any other application substances as DB/API dataset or UI visual objects). VIVIDUS provides a ready-to-use implemented language to write executable tests, it's named - Test Actions Language. Test Actions Language is human-readable and written in Gherkin format to ensure the clarity of it to users of any technical level; on the other hand Test Actions Language is not limited to any specific application or domain as itâ€™s commonly done in classical BDD approach.

VIVIDUS is developed for testers to create automated tests for any kind of applications, any kind of tests, any combination of tests but using the single tool and common language.
