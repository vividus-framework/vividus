= Secrets Management and Sensitive Data Protection

== Encryption

It is allowed to store values of the properties in the encrypted form.
VIVIDUS uses Jasypt (Java Simplified Encryption) which provides two-way
encryption mechanism. While performing two-way encryption, apart from feeding
plain-text it's required to feed the secret text (i.e. password) and this secret
text is used to decrypt the encrypted text. The default encryption algorithm is
`PBEWithMD5AndDES`.

=== How to encrypt a string
==== Option 1 (Recommended): using Jasypt CLI

. Download the https://github.com/jasypt/jasypt/releases[latest Jasypt release]
. Unpack the downloaded zip-archive
. Go to `bin` folder
. Run the command performing encryption:
+
.Windows:
[source,bat]
----
encrypt.bat input="This is my message to be encrypted" password=MYPAS_WORD
----
+
.Linux/UNIX/macOS:
[source,shell]
----
./encrypt.sh input="This is my message to be encrypted" password=MYPAS_WORD
----
+
where
+
 - `input` - Any string to be encrypted.
 - `password` - Your encryption password.
+
NOTE: `MYPAS_WORD` is a sample password and should be never used, own strong password is required for the encryption.

. Find the encrypted data in `OUTPUT` section

==== Option 2: using https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/jasypt-online-encryption-decryption[Jasypt Online]

CAUTION: Use this tool at your own risk, since there is a chance of potential leakage of sensitive data

. Paste plain text string to encrypt to the corresponding text field.
. Set Type of Encryption to "Two Way Encryption (With Secret Text)".
. Enter secret key/text in the corresponding text field.
. Click "Encrypt".
. The resulting encrypted string can be copied from the corresponding field.

=== How to use an encrypted string

. Set the password in one of the following ways:
+
.. Pass the key with its password-value into a test run using command line:
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew runStories -Pvividus.encryptor.password=MYPAS_WORD
----
+
.. Add the password to the system project properties as the value of:
+
[source,properties]
----
system.vividus.encryptor.password=MYPAS_WORD
----
+
.. Set via OS environment variable `VIVIDUS_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD`
+
Keep in mind that a password specified in the command line takes priority over the project system property,
and the project system property takes priority over the environment variable.
+
IMPORTANT: This password must be kept secret and must not be committed to version control system.
+
NOTE: `MYPAS_WORD` is a sample password and should be never used, own strong password is required for the encryption.

. Use the case-sensitive wrapping `ENC(...)` for any encrypted property value. e.g.
+
[source,properties]
----
http.auth.password=ENC(WVnXhzG704KRZZFYL7hfpA4YoSm8V2F5eNXyr7CRYCichteHvNS3nB23zaI8CuLy)

Please see xref:tests-configuration.adoc#_externalized_configuration[Externalized Configuration section] to get more
information on how encryptor password can be passed to the tests.

==== Configuration

Firstly, it is required to configure Vault endpoint and authentication method.

NOTE: The properties marked with *bold* are mandatory.

|Property
|Description
|Example

|[subs=+quotes]`*vault.uri*`
|Vault enpoint
|`http://127.0.0.1:8200`

|[subs=+quotes]`*vault.token*`
a|Token authentication requires a static token to be provided.
[NOTE]
====
Token authentication is just one of several authentication methods that are https://docs.spring.io/spring-vault/docs/current/reference/html/index.html#vault.core.environment-vault-configuration[supported].
====
|`dev-only-token`

|`vault.namespace`
|Vault Enterprise allows using https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/namespaces[namespaces] to isolate multiple Vaults on a single Vault server. This feature is not supported by Vault Community edition and has no effect on Vault operations.
|`ns1/ns2`

==== How to refer Vault secrets
. Find the required secrets in Vault.
+
image::vault.png[Secrets in Vault,width=70%]

. Build full paths to the secrets. For the secrets listed above, the paths would be `secret/vividus/test/username` and
`secret/vividus/test/password`.
. Put the built paths to properties using the case-sensitive wrapping `VAULT(...)`
+
[source,properties]
----
db.connection.test.username=VAULT(secret/vividus/test/username)
db.connection.test.password=VAULT(secret/vividus/test/password)
