= Tests Configuration

== `configuration.properties`

The Vividus configuration includes the following parts: profiles, environments and suites.

=== Suites

The property `configuration.suites` defines the suites set. It is a comma separated set of suite file addresses:

.configuration.properties
----
configuration.suites=testSuite,anotherDir/anotherTestSuite
----
The Vividus suite consists of the unlimited number of batches. In its turn the batch consists of any number of stories represented by the files with `*.story` extension. The batches are run sequentially, while the stories in the batch are run in parallel.

The suites are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence, in other words, the values of the properties defined in the first suite will take precedence over the values of the same properties defined in all subsequent suites.

The following properties are used to configure batches (Vividus doesn't provide any default batch configuration out of the box). `batch-number` is one-based batch index.

NOTE: The properties marked with *bold* are mandatory.

== Known Issues

Known issues mechanism allows to distinguish failures from known issues presented in the system under test.

[IMPORTANT]
JSON file should contain a valid JSON. If JSON is not valid known issues will be ignored and warning about invalid file will be printed.

=== Properties

[cols="2,1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Property
|Default value
|Description

|`known-issue-provider.fileName`
|`known-issues.json`
|Defines the location of the known issues file

|`known-issue-provider.detect-potentially-known-issues`
|`true`
|Defines are potentially known issues detected
|===

=== Known Issues file

The file represents a collection of JSON elements describing known issues.

.known-issues.json
[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
 {
    "VVD-1": { <1>
        "type": "Internal",<2>
        "assertionPattern": "Expected: a value equal to 200, Actual: \\[404\\]", <3>
        "storyPattern": "Validate the Math", <4>
        "scenarioPattern": "Validate equality", <5>
        "stepPattern": "Then `1` is = `2`.+", <6>
        "variablePatterns": { <7>
            "var":  "value-.*"
        },
        "failScenarioFast": true, <8>
        "failStoryFast": true <9>
    }
}
----
<1> [Mandatory] *Identifier* (This could be an ID of the issue in your bug tracking system)
<2> [Mandatory] *Issue type.* One of: INTERNAL (application issue), EXTERNAL (3rd party issue), AUTOMATION (test automation issue)
<3> [Mandatory] *Assertion pattern* describes which failed assertions should be considered as known
<4> Story pattern to match failed story name
<5> Scenario pattern to match failed scenario name
<6> Step pattern to match failed step.
<7> Variable patterns. Patterns to match variables.
<8> Skip the rest of scenario in case of failure identified as this known issue
<9> Skip the rest of story in case of failure identified as this known issue

[IMPORTANT]
Use *\\* for escaping of special characters in regular expressions

=== Examples

* To consider failed assertion known or potentially-known *assertionPattern* should match assertion failure, if defined *variablePatterns* should match also.
* If *assertionPattern*/*variablePatterns* matched and you have *story/scenario/step/Pattern* defined, to consider issue known all of them should match.
* If *assertionPattern*/*variablePatterns* matched and you have *story/scenario/step/Pattern* defined, when at least one not matched issue is considered potentially known.

== Meta tags

Meta tags can be used to reach several goals:

* Grouping of stories and scenarios in the report.
* Dynamic selection of tests to execute by meta tags.
* Management of capabilities for the particular tests.

=== Levels
Meta tags may be used at both story and scenario level. Meta tags specified at the story level are propagated to every scenario, if the same meta tag is used at the scenario level, then the scenario level value takes precedence.

.Levels of meta tags
[source,gherkin]
----
!-- Story level
Meta:
     @group Login

Scenario: Open Epam main page
!-- Scenario level
Meta:
  @severity 1
  @layout desktop
Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://www.epam.com/'
Then the page title is equal to 'EPAM | Enterprise Software Development, Design & Consulting'

Scenario: Open Google main page
Meta:
  @severity 2
  @layout desktop
  @skip
Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://www.google.com/'
Then the page title is equal to 'Google'
----

=== Properties

The property `bdd.meta-filters` is used to filter tests to be executed and
relies on Groovy syntax.

.Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and matching default filters
[source,properties]
----
bdd.meta-filters=group == 'Login'
----

The prorerty `bdd.all-meta-filters` is used to override values of the default
meta filters based on the tags: `@skip`, `@layout`, `@browserWindowSize` etc.

.Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and without '@skip' tag
[source,properties]
----
bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: (group == 'Login' && !skip)
----

==== Limitations

Since meta filters properties are based on Groovy, meta tags names support
https://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_normal_identifiers[only normal Groovy identifiers]
by default. If it's required to use arbitrary characters in meta tags names
(e.g.follow kebab-case notation which actively relies on the hyphen char), then
https://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_quoted_identifiers[quoted identifiers] or
subscript operator must be used in the properties.

.Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (quoted identifiers approach)
[source,properties]
----
bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this.'test-stand'
----

.Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (subscript operator approach)
[source,properties]
----
bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this['test-stand']
----

=== 1D tags (@key)

|Tag Key
|Allowed values
|Description
|Example

|@severity
|Numeric values (range 1-5)
|Used to mark importance of the test where, most usually, the smallest number is the most important Test, the highest number is the least important.
|`@severity 1`

|@layout
|`desktop`, `phone`, `phone_portrait`, `phone_landscape`, `chrome_phone`, `chrome_responsive`, `chrome_tablet`, `tablet`, `tablet_landscape`, `tablet_portrait`
|Used to specify layout, using which marked story or scenario should be executed. In case if this meta tag is not specified, default (`desktop`) value is used for web applications.
|`@layout desktop`

|@browserWindowSize
|Any browser window size in pixels, e.g. `800x600`. Note: browser window size should be smaller than the current screen resolution.
|Used to specify browser window size. It can be applied on both story and scenario levels. In case, if browser size differs between adjacent scenarios, browser window will be simply resized to desired values, browser session will not be restarted. If the tag is not set for story or scenario, the browser window will be maximized to the screen size during local test execution.
|`@browserWindowSize 1024x768`
|===

== Reporting

User has possibility to link stories/scenarios to an external systems like TMS or bug-tracking systems.

There is a few steps to achieve this:


. Configure link pattern via properties
. Add metatag to the story/sceanrio meta


.environment.properties
----
system.allure.link.issue.pattern=https://vividus.dev/issues/{}
----

.Test.story
----
Meta:
    @issueId VVD-1

Scenario: Should check variables equals
Then `1` is = `1`
----

=== Configuration

[cols="3,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
|Property
|Meta tag
|Description
|Example

|system.allure.link.issue.pattern
|@issueId
|Defines issue link pattern
|https://github.com/vividus-framework/vividus/issues/{}

|system.allure.link.requirement.pattern
|@requirementId
|Defines requirement link pattern
|https://github.com/vividus-framework/vividus/issues/{}

|system.allure.link.tms.pattern
|@testCaseId
|Defines test case link pattern
|https://vividus.jira.com/issues/{}
|===

=== Mutiple endpoints

It is possible to have multiple endpoints. To achieve this user should define system suffix for the properties and meta tags.

.environment.properties
----
# Default property
system.allure.link.issue.pattern=https://vividus.prod/issues/{}
# Additional property with .dev suffix, that used to create links annotated with @isssueId.dev
system.allure.link.issue.dev.pattern=https://vividus.dev/issues/{}
----

.Test.story
----
Meta:
    @issueId VVD-1
    @issueId.dev DEV-1

Scenario: Should check variables equal
Then `1` is = `1`
----

image::multiple-links.png[Multiple links]

== Story Prioritization

In order to start stories in particular order it is possible to assign the stories a numeric priority, the stories with the higher priority start first.

To enable the feature create a file `spring.xml` in the `src/main/resources` directory and add the following XML data into that file.

.Configuration
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd"
       default-lazy-init="false">

    <bean class="org.vividus.bdd.priority.MetaBasedStoryExecutionPriority" factory-method="byNumericMetaValue">
        <constructor-arg index="0" value="story_priority" />
    </bean>
</beans>
----

The `story_priority` value that corresponds to a meta name in stories can be changed to arbitrary value without spaces.

Taking `story_priority` as an example the priority meta should be placed at the story level as the following example shows:

.Prioritized.story
[source,gherkin]
----
Meta: @story_priority 15

Scenario: Time consuming test
When I perform highly time consuming task
----

== ExamplesTable

=== Mapping values to `null`-s

By default all empty values in `ExamplesTable` are treated as empty strings. However
it might be required to map certain values to `null`-s. It can be done at the step
implementation level or by applying the generic approach at the table level:

[source,gherkin]
----
{nullPlaceholder=NULL}
|header |
|value 1|
|NULL   |
|value 3|
----

== Exit codes

The tests execution returns one of the following exit codes.

[cols="1,8,1", options="header"]
|===
|Code
|Description
|Status

|0
|Test report is generated, contains only passed tests
|`GREEN`

|1
|Test report is generated, contains only passed and tests with known issues
|`AMBER`

|2
|Test report is generated, contains any tests except passed and with known issues or doesn't contain tests at all
|`RED`

|3
|Test report isn't generated
|`RED`
