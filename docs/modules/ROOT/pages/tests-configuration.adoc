= Tests Configuration

== `configuration.properties`

VIVIDUS configuration includes the following parts: xref:tests-configuration.adoc#_suites[suites], xref:ROOT:tests-configuration.adoc#_profiles[profiles] and xref:tests-configuration.adoc#_environments[environments].

[WARNING]
====
Properties prefixed with `*configuration.*` should be specified in the following locations only:

* The system properties.
* The `*configuration.properties*` file.
* The `*overriding.properties*` file.
====

=== Suites

The property `configuration.suites` defines the suites set. It is a comma separated set of suite file addresses:

.configuration.properties
[source,properties]
----
configuration.suites=testSuite,anotherDir/anotherTestSuite
----
VIVIDUS suite consists of the unlimited number of batches. In its turn the batch consists of any number of stories represented by the files with `*.story` extension. The batches are run sequentially, while the stories in the batch are run in parallel.

The suites are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence, in other words, the values of the properties defined in the first suite will take precedence over the values of the same properties defined in all subsequent suites. If any of the suites in the sequence is not found (i.e. no `\*.properties` file is present at the given path), the error will be thrown and the execution will be stopped. However if suites property is empty (`configuration.suites=`) and no suite is configured in the root (i.e no files can be found by `/properties/suite/*.properties` pattern), no error will be thrown and the execution will be continued.

The following properties are used to configure batches (VIVIDUS doesn't provide any default batch configuration out of the box). `batch-number` is one-based batch index.

NOTE: The properties marked with *bold* are mandatory.

=== Profiles

A profile defines the subject of the test, i.e. it answers the question "What are specifics of the browser/device I want to run tests on?".

These specifics (properties) should be written in the `profile.properties` file. Path to this file is set in `configuration.properties` file:

.configuration.properties
[source,properties]
----
configuration.profiles=web
----

It's allowed to create multiple profiles. This can be useful for cross-browsing or cross-device testing: there is no need of changing all the properties, just switch the profile. +
As well as the suites, profiles are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence. This allows to reuse common properties and separate specific ones.

==== Profiles setup

Define the number of profiles you need to set up. In case of multiple profiles, distinguish common and specific properties and put them into `profile.properties` files in appropriate places.

WARNING: Please keep in mind that running multiple profiles (e.g. for Chrome and Firefox simultaneously) is not supported. All the properties would be merged, but not iterated as separate profiles for scenario execution.

Let's create an example. Imagine that our project contains automated scenarios for a couple of platforms: web and mobile. We will need to run autotests on different browsers and different devices. Therefore some of the properties would be common, but many of them should only belong to a certain subject. Let's see profiles structure for this case:

[source,dir,subs=attributes+]
----
└─ src/main/resources/properties
                            └─  profile <1>
                                    ├─ web <2>
                                        ├─ chrome <4>
                                                └─ profile.properties <6>
                                        ├─ firefox <4>
                                                └─ profile.properties
                                        └─ profile.properties <5>
                                    ├─ mobile_app <2>
                                            ├─ iOS <7>
                                                └─ profile.properties
                                            ├─ android <7>
                                                └─ profile.properties <9>
                                            └─ profile.properties <8>
                                    └─ profile.properties <3>

----
<1> Profile directory which contains all the profiles properties;
<2> General type of the profiles, either a browser or a mobile device;
<3> The highest level of profile properties. Values written in this file will be applied to any browser or device;
<4> Web browsers' profiles (directories);
<5> Web-oriented properties. Values from this file will be applied for any web browser, but not for mobiles;
<6> Chrome-specific profile. Any properties written here will not affect any other browsers or mobile devices;
<7> Mobile profiles (directories);
<8> Mobile-oriented properties. Values from this file will be applied for iOS and Android devices only;
<9> Android-specific profile. Any properties written here will not affect iOS devices or any browser setup;

By default, profile property is pointed to the `/src/main/resources/properties/profile` directory, so use the relative path starting from `profile` when you have nested directories:

.configuration.properties
[source,properties]
----
configuration.profiles=mobile_app/android
----

==== Built-in profiles

Some of the plugins, like xref:plugins:plugin-web-app.adoc#_profiles[web-app], have built-in profiles. You can find them in project explorer after installation by the following path:

[source,dir]
----
Referenced Libraries -> vividus-plugin-name -> properties -> profile
----

=== Environments

Depending on the stage of the project, you will likely need to run automated scenarios on different environments, such as development, testing, and production servers.

Rather than using specific variables in each profile or suite, always updating them according to the currently selected server, and eventually making mistakes, we instead use the environment configuration.

Environment configuration allows putting environment-related variables (e.g. host, API endpoint) into `environment.properties` file. The path to this file is set in `configuration.properties` file. Create as many property files as a number of environments you have and easily switch between them:

.configuration.properties
[source,properties]
----
configuration.environments=dev
#configuration.environments=test
#configuration.environments=prod
----

Environment variables can also be declared in multiple files. Define common and specific properties for your environments and take the xref:ROOT:tests-configuration.adoc#_profiles_setup[same approach] of reusing and separating values.

=== Configuration sets

Configuration set simplifies reusage of pre-defined combinations of profiles/suites/environments. Users are allowed to define multiple configuration sets. Only one configuration set can be used during a test run.

.Configuration sets definition
[source,properties]
----
configuration-set.api-preprod-uat.profiles=
configuration-set.api-preprod-uat.suites=uat
configuration-set.api-preprod-uat.environments=preprod

configuration-set.api-test-regression.profiles=
configuration-set.api-test-regression.suites=regression
configuration-set.api-test-regression.environments=test
----

Once configuration sets are defined, one can use an active configuration set for test execution.

.Usage of configuration set
[source,properties]
----
configuration-set.active=api-preprod-uat
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Configuration sets can be defined only in `configuration.properties` file.
* Active configuration set overrides defined `configuration.profiles`, `configuration.suites` and `configuration.environments` properties.
* Configuration set requires to define `profiles`, `suites` and `environments`, empty value considered as a valid one.
====

== Known Issues

Known issues mechanism allows to distinguish failures from known issues presented in the system under test.

[IMPORTANT]
JSON file should contain a valid JSON. If JSON is not valid known issues will be ignored and warning about invalid file will be printed.

=== Properties

[cols="2,1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Property
|Default value
|Description

|`known-issue-provider.fileName`
|`known-issues.json`
|Defines the location of the known issues file

|`known-issue-provider.detect-potentially-known-issues`
|`true`
|Defines are potentially known issues detected
|===

=== Known Issues file

The file represents a collection of JSON elements describing known issues.

.known-issues.json
[source,json,subs=attributes+]
----
 {
    "VVD-1": { <1>
        "type": "Internal",<2>
        "assertionPattern": "Expected: a value equal to 200, Actual: \\[404\\]", <3>
        "storyPattern": "Validate the Math", <4>
        "scenarioPattern": "Validate equality", <5>
        "stepPattern": "Then `1` is = `2`.+", <6>
        "variablePatterns": { <7>
            "var":  "value-.*"
        },
        "failScenarioFast": true, <8>
        "failStoryFast": true, <9>
        "description": "Missing endpoint configuration on server side" <10>
    }
}
----
<1> [Mandatory] *Identifier* (This could be an ID of the issue in your bug tracking system)
<2> [Mandatory] *Issue type.* One of: INTERNAL (application issue), EXTERNAL (3rd party issue), AUTOMATION (test automation issue)
<3> [Mandatory] *Assertion pattern* describes which failed assertions should be considered as known
<4> Story pattern to match the file name of the failed story. Pay attention, the file name extension (`.story`) should not be included in the pattern, only base file name is matched.
<5> Scenario pattern to match failed scenario name
<6> Step pattern to match failed step.
<7> Variable patterns. Patterns to match variables.
<8> Skip the rest of scenario in case of failure identified as this known issue
<9> Skip the rest of story in case of failure identified as this known issue
<10> Known issue description, it's used to give the meaningful explanation of the issue if it's not tracked in bug tracking system or if the issue is too complicated and to improve overall transparency

[IMPORTANT]
Use *\\* for escaping of special characters in regular expressions

=== Examples

* To consider failed assertion known or potentially-known *assertionPattern* should match assertion failure, if defined *variablePatterns* should match also.
* If *assertionPattern*/*variablePatterns* matched and you have *story/scenario/step/Pattern* defined, to consider issue known all of them should match.
* If *assertionPattern*/*variablePatterns* matched and you have *story/scenario/step/Pattern* defined, when at least one not matched issue is considered potentially known.

== Meta tags

Meta tags can be used to reach several goals:

* Grouping of stories and scenarios in the report.
* Dynamic selection of tests to execute by meta tags.
* Management of capabilities for the particular tests.

=== Levels
Meta tags may be used at both story and scenario level. Meta tags specified at the story level are propagated to every scenario, if the same meta tag is used at the scenario level, then the scenario level value takes precedence.

.Levels of meta tags
[source,gherkin]
----
!-- Story level
Meta:
     @group Login

Scenario: Open Epam main page
!-- Scenario level
Meta:
  @priority 1
  @layout desktop
Given I am on page with URL `https://www.epam.com/`
Then page title is equal to `EPAM | Enterprise Software Development, Design & Consulting`

Scenario: Open Google main page
Meta:
  @priority 2
  @layout desktop
  @skip
Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/`
Then page title is equal to `Google`
----

=== Properties

The property `bdd.meta-filters` is used to filter tests to be executed and
relies on Groovy syntax.

.Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and matching default filters
[source,properties]
----
bdd.meta-filters=group == 'Login'
----

The prorerty `bdd.all-meta-filters` is used to override values of the default
meta filters based on the tags: `@skip`, `@layout` etc.

.Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and without '@skip' tag
[source,properties]
----
bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: (group == 'Login' && !skip)
----

==== Limitations

Since meta filters properties are based on Groovy, meta tags names support
https://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_normal_identifiers[only normal Groovy identifiers]
by default. If it's required to use arbitrary characters in meta tags names
(e.g.follow kebab-case notation which actively relies on the hyphen char), then
https://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_quoted_identifiers[quoted identifiers] or
subscript operator must be used in the properties.

.Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (quoted identifiers approach)
[source,properties]
----
bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this.'test-stand'
----

.Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (subscript operator approach)
[source,properties]
----
bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this['test-stand']
----

=== 1D tags (@key)
[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
|Tag
|Description

|`@skip`
|Used to exclude particular scenarios from the test execution

|Description
|Example

|@layout
|`desktop`, `phone`, `chrome_phone`, `chrome_responsive`, `chrome_tablet`, `tablet`
|Used to specify layout, using which marked story or scenario should be executed. In case if this meta tag is not specified, default (`desktop`) value is used for web applications.
|`@layout desktop`

|===

== Story Prioritization

In order to start stories in particular order it is possible to assign the stories a numeric priority, the stories with the higher priority start first.

To enable the feature create a file `spring.xml` in the `src/main/resources` directory and add the following XML data into that file.

.Configuration
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd"
       default-lazy-init="false">

    <bean class="org.vividus.priority.MetaBasedStoryExecutionPriority" factory-method="byNumericMetaValue">
        <constructor-arg index="0" value="story_priority" />
    </bean>
</beans>
----

The `story_priority` value that corresponds to a meta name in stories can be changed to arbitrary value without spaces.

Taking `story_priority` as an example the priority meta should be placed at the story level as the following example shows:

.Prioritized.story
[source,gherkin]
----
Meta: @story_priority 15

Scenario: Time consuming test
When I perform highly time consuming task
----

== Exit codes

The tests execution returns one of the following exit codes.

[cols="1,9,1", options="header"]
|===
|Code
|Description
|Status

|0
|Test report is generated, contains only passed tests.
|`GREEN`

|1
|Test report is generated, contains only passed and tests with known issues.
|`AMBER`

|2
|Test report is generated, contains any tests except passed and with known issues or doesn't contain tests at all.
|`RED`

|3
a|Test report isn't generated.

*Common errors:*

* "InvalidConfigurationException: No batches with tests to execute are configured" -
the <<_suites,configured suite>> has 0 batches, i.e. no tests to execute are configured.

== Externalized Configuration

Most common use cases for externalized configuration are tests parametrization with properties passed from CI/CD pipeline,
passing of secrets into test run etc. The available approaches are listed below.

. Declare an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable[environment variable] containing the desired property value and
then point the property to the declared environment variable:
+
[source,shell]
----
export EXTERNAL_CONFIG_VALUE=value
----
+
[source,properties]
----
variables.some-key=${EXTERNAL_CONFIG_VALUE}
----
+

. Pass the property with its value into a test run using command line arguments prepending it with the `-Pvividus.` prefix.
The prefix only plays role during test start-up phase and cut off during the actual test run:
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew runStories -Pvividus.variables.some-key-1=value1 -Pvividus.variables.some-key-2=value2
----
+
This approach can be used only when tests are run via Gradle.

. Generate the `overriding.properties` file on-the-fly and put it into corresponding folder in a test project.
+
The following script assumes that we are in the root of the test project folder.
+
[source,shell]
----
cat > src/main/resources/overriding.properties << EOD
variables.some-key-1=value1
variables.some-key-2=value2
EOD
----
+
This approach can be used only when tests are run via Gradle.

== Composite steps

https://jbehave.org/reference/stable/composite-steps.html[Composite steps] allow to reuse set of actions via custom steps with own wordings.

=== How to use composite steps

. Define composite step in `*.steps` file, e.g. `steps/ui/my-app.steps`:
+
.Composite step definition
[source,gherkin]
----
Composite: When I login with username `$username` and password `$password`
When I enter `<username>` in field located by `id(username)`
When I enter `<password>` in field located by `id(password)`
When I click on element located by `id(signInButton)`
----

. Configure paths to files with custom steps:
+
.Composite steps paths configuration
[source,gherkin]
----
engine.composite-paths=steps/ui/*.steps
----

. Use your step in the story:
+
.Composite step usage example
[source,gherkin]
----

== Steps aliases

VIVIDUS allows to define set of aliases for steps in JSON format and then use them in stories.

=== How to use steps aliases

. Select a step you want to create alias for, as an example let's take the following step:
+
.VIVIDUS step
[source,gherkin]
----
When I hover mouse over element located `$locator`
----

. Create a new JSON file (for example, `aliases/aliases.json`) and put the following content with one or more aliases:
+
.aliases/aliases.json
[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "name": "When I hover mouse over element located `$locator`",
        "aliases":
        [
            {
                "name": "When I place mouse pointer over web element located by `$locator`"
            },
            {
                "name": "When I hover mouse pointer over web element located `$locator`"
            }
        ]
    }
]
----

. Point the alias configuration property to an exact location or location pattern with the JSON files containing aliases:
+
[source,properties]
----
engine.alias-paths=aliases/aliases.json
----

. Use the defined alias in place of actual step in your story
