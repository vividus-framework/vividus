= Tests Configuration

== Selenium Grid

* `selenium.grid.username` - defines remote grid username
* `selenium.grid.password` - defines remote grid password
* `selenium.grid.host` - defines remote grid hostname

== Known Issues

Known issues mechanism allows to distinguish failures from known issues presented in the system under test.

[IMPORTANT]
JSON file should contain a valid JSON. If JSON is not valid known issues will be ignored and warning about invalid file will be printed.

=== Properties

=== Known Issues file

The file represents a collection of JSON elements describing known issues.

.known-issues.json

----
 {
    "VVD-1": { <1>
        "type": "Internal",<2>
        "assertionPattern": "Expected: a value equal to 200, Actual: \\[404\\]" <3>
        "storyPattern": "Validate the Math", <4>

}
----
<1> [Mandatory] *Identifier* (This could be an ID of the issue in your bug tracking system)
<2> [Mandatory] *Issue type.* One of: INTERNAL (application issue), EXTERNAL (3rd party issue), AUTOMATION (test automation issue)
<3> [Mandatory] *Assertion pattern* describes which failed assertions should be considered as known
<4> Story pattern to match failed story name
<5> Scenario pattern to match failed scenario name
<6> Step pattern to match failed step.
<7> Variable patterns. Patterns to match variables.

[IMPORTANT]
Use *\\* for escaping of special characters in regular expressions

=== Examples

* To consider failed assertion known or potentially-known *assertionPattern* should match assertion failure, if defined *variablePatterns* should match also.
* If *assertionPattern*/*variablePatterns* matched and you have *story/scenario/step/Pattern* defined, to consider issue known all of them should match.
* If *assertionPattern*/*variablePatterns* matched and you have *story/scenario/step/Pattern* defined, when at least one not matched issue is considered potentially known.
