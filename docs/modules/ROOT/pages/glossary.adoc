== Resource
*Synoyms*: project resource, test resource.

A resource is data (text, images, audio, and so on) that tests need to access
in a way that is independent of the location of the test source code (either
it's a local tests execution from IDE, or via Gradle, or from test artifact
in CI/CD).

All resources are located in `src/main/resources` folder of the test project by
default. A resource name is a path relative to this folder, e.g. the resource
located at:

----
└─ src
    └─ main
        └─ resources
            └─ data
                └─ request.json
----

can be referenced in the tests as `/data/request.json`.

The name of a resource is independent of the used operating system;
in particular, the path separator is always a slash `/`.
