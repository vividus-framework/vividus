## View the test execution report

At the end of any test run, VIVIDUS will give you a link to where the corresponding test report was published. It should look like this:

[source,log]
----
2022-05-23 13:38:15,523 [main] INFO  org.vividus.report.allure.AllureReportGenerator - Allure report is successfully generated at /dir/to/where/the/results-are-published/.out/vividus-demo/reports/allure/index.html
----

Modern browsers don't allow to open the report hosted on the local filesystem
https://stackoverflow.com/a/24002146/2067574[due to security restrictions].
The following options could be considered.

### Option 1 (Safe, but a bit complicated)

. Go into the directory:
+
[source,shell]
----
cd /dir/to/where/the/results-are-published/.out/vividus-demo/reports/allure
----

. Start a webserver of your choice, in the example below we are using a https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server[node webserver] through port `3456`:
+
[source,shell]
----
    ✔ ~/dir/to/where/the/results-are-published/.out/vividus-demo/reports/allure
    $ http-server -p 3456
----

. Launch a browser, type `localhost:3456` into the URL. If you followed the instructions properly, you should see your report.

### Option 2 (Relax browser security)
. Tune https://testingfreak.com/how-to-fix-cross-origin-request-security-cors-error-in-firefox-chrome-and-ie/[CORS option in the browser of your choice].
+
WARNING: Make sure this browser will be used to view test reports only, it's not safe to surf the Internet with relaxed security rules.
. Go to the test report directory and open `index.html` in the configured browser.
