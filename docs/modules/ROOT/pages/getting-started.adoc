= Getting Started

Everyone has to start somewhere and if you’re new to VIVIDUS, this is where to begin.

== Before you start
In order to use VIVIDUS effectively, you need to know what it is and understand
some of its fundamental concepts. So before you start using VIVIDUS in earnest,
we highly recommend you read xref:ROOT:tests-configuration.adoc["How to cook VIVIDUS?"].

== Prerequisites

=== Install and configure Git
. Download and install http://git-scm.com/downloads[Git client]
. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup#_your_identity[Configure] your identity

=== Install Java
. https://jdk.java.net/17/[LTS JDK 17] is the baseline. https://jdk.java.net/11/[LTS JDK 11] and the latest https://jdk.java.net/18/[JDK 18] are supported as well.
. https://www.baeldung.com/java-home-on-windows-7-8-10-mac-os-x-linux[Configure `JAVA_HOME` environment variable] to point your directory with installed JDK.
. Add new entry to `PATH` environment variable:
    * for Windows: `%JAVA_HOME%/bin`
    * for macOS / Linux: `$JAVA_HOME/bin`

== Create tests project
. Login to http://github.com/[GitHub] (create a new account at first if you don't have any).
. Generate your own project based on the starter project:
- open https://github.com/vividus-framework/vividus-starter/generate[generator]
- provide repository name for your test project
- choose option to set visibility of your repository: `Public` or `Private` (`Private` is recommended from start, it can be changed in future)
. Clone your newly generated repository:
+
[source,shell]
----
git clone --recursive your_generated_project_url.git
----

. Go to the local directory with your cloned repository:
+
[source,shell]
----
cd your_repository_name
----

. Build the project:
+
- macOS / Linux:
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew build
----

- Windows:
+
[source,cmd]
----
gradlew build
----

== Use IDE for the tests development

=== Eclipse

==== Prerequisites
. Install https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2022-03/r/eclipse-ide-java-developers[Eclipse IDE 2022-03]
. Add https://jbehave.org/eclipse-integration.html[JBehave plugin]

==== Import the project
. Generate Eclipse configuration files:
+
- macOS / Linux:
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew eclipse
----

- Windows:
+
[source,cmd]
----
gradlew eclipse
----

. https://help.eclipse.org/2022-03/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftasks-importproject.htm[Import the project to Eclipse]
. Start creating your tests

## Execute the tests via CLI
. Execute your tests via Gradle:
+
- macOS / Linux:
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew runStories
----

- Windows:
+
[source,cmd]
----
gradlew runStories
----

## View the test execution report

At the end of any test run, VIVIDUS will give you a link to where the corresponding test report was published. It should look like this:

[source,log]
----
2022-05-23 13:38:15,523 [main] INFO  org.vividus.report.allure.AllureReportGenerator - Allure report is successfully generated at /dir/to/where/the/results-are-published/.out/vividus-demo/reports/allure/index.html
----

It's not allowed to open the report hosted on the local filesystem
https://stackoverflow.com/a/24002146/2067574[due to security restrictions].
The following options could be considered.

### Option 1 (Safe, but a bit complicated)

. Go into the directory:
+
[source,shell]
----
cd /dir/to/where/the/results-are-published/.out/vividus-demo/reports/allure
----

. Start a webserver of your choice, in the example below we are using a https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server[node webserver] through port `3456`:
+
[source,shell]
----
    ✔ ~/dir/to/where/the/results-are-published/.out/vividus-demo/reports/allure
    $ http-server -p 3456
----

. Launch a browser, type `localhost:3456` into the URL. If you followed the instructions properly, you should see your report.

### Option 2 (Relax browser security)
. Tune https://testingfreak.com/how-to-fix-cross-origin-request-security-cors-error-in-firefox-chrome-and-ie/[CORS option in the browser of your choice].
+
WARNING: Make sure this browser will be used to view test reports only, it's not safe to surf the Internet with relaxed security rules.
. Go to the test report directory and open `index.html` in the configured browser.
