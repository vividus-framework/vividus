= How to use VIVIDUS MCP server to create automated scenarios

The VIVIDUS MCP server exposes core VIVIDUS functionalities to LLMs via the MCP protocol, enabling generation of automated
test scenarios leveraging those capabilities.

IMPORTANT: LLM will access only those steps that are available from plugins included into your test project.

== Prerequisites

. Copy the below line to `dependencies` section of the project `build.gradle` file in your test project
+
[IMPORTANT]
VIVIDUS MCP server is available starting from version `0.6.16-SNAPSHOT` and higher.
+
.build.gradle
[source,gradle,subs="attributes+"]
----
implementation(group: 'org.vividus', name: 'vividus-mcp-server')
----
. Make sure to use https://github.com/vividus-framework/vividus-build-system?tab=readme-ov-file#migrating-from-20-to-30[Build System 3.0]
. Update `gradlew` script in the root of your test project to the latest version:
.. Go to https://github.com/vividus-framework/vividus-starter/blob/main/gradlew
.. Copy content of the `gradlew` script
.. Replace the content of the `gradlew` script in the root of the test project with the copied content

== VIVIDUS Website Testing Guide with GitHub Copilot 

=== Getting Started 

Switching to Agent Mode 

. Open VS Code 
. Click on `GitHub Copilot` icon in the status bar 
. Select `Agent` from the menu (kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+I]) 
. Choose the preferred agent (list of available agents could differ based on your license) 

=== Common Prompt Files 

A prompt file stores stable instructions and constraints for the AI agent. Use it to fix style, allowed steps, locator conventions, and validation rules so every generated test follows team standards. 

Benefits of prompt file usage: 

* Centralized rules for test generation 
* Reuse across test creation sessions 
* Easier auditing and regression when rules change 

==== Prompt file setup

.   Create a `.github/prompts` folder in VS Code (if it doesn't exist)  
.   Place the ready-made prompt file into the `.github/prompts` folder  
+
[IMPORTANT]
The prompt file must have the `.prompt.md` extension (e.g., `test-template.prompt.md`). This extension ensures proper recognition by VS Code and GitHub Copilot  
+
.   Specify the path to your tests folder in the prompt. 
.   Drag and drop the prompt file as an attachment into the GitHub Сopilot chat OR attach file via `Add context` button (kbd:[Ctrl+/]).  

Prompt example of content for `test-template.prompt.md`: 

```
Used steps should strictly follow the steps' structure, grammar, and syntax. 
Use the provided VIVIDUS steps from the input list exactly as they are given. 
Steps should begin with Given, When, or Then. DO NOT add additional words. Only parameters can be added. 
Use real locators for real elements that from provided URL. DO NOT create non-existent locators. 
Use Locator types id(idValue), xpath(xpathValue). 
```

== Starting MCP Server

.  Open the terminal in VS Code.
.  Run the MCP server.
.  Wait for the server to initialize.

== Writing Tests with AI Assistance

Prompt example with specifically defined scope of testing scenario:

```
Open `https://example.com/` page.
Close any opened pop-ups.
Check Search functionality.
```

This will generate a test with:

*  Browser initialization.
*  URL navigation.
*  Pop-up handling.
*  Search functionality verification.

Prompt example with general Web testing scenarios (scenarios list generated by AI):

```
Open `https://example.com/` page and write test automation scenarios demonstrating Vividus tool capabilities for web application testing.
```

This will generate multiple scenarios covering:

*  Page navigation.
*  Basic element interactions.
*  Key elements verification.

=== Best Practices for AI Test Generation

.  **Be Specific**: Include exact URLs and scope details.
.  **State Requirements**: Mention specific validations needed.
.  **Indicate Patterns or Approaches**.
.  **Store Common Prompt Logic**: Save common prompt logic in a separate prompt file to avoid copy-pasting across different chats and minimize session context expiration effects.

== Q&A

=== Q: I want my tests to be automatically executed after creation. What should I update or prompt?

[IMPORTANT]

Please be aware of token limits. Set up auto-execution only if you are confident and polish your prompt file.

Prompt example to include auto-run of test cases after confirmation in chat:

```
After generating the test script:
1. Confirm test execution by responding `"Yes, execute the tests"`.
2. Tests will be executed automatically with:
   - Chrome desktop profile.
   - Newly created story files.
   - Real-time execution logs.
3. Results will be provided in the chat showing:
   - Execution status.
   - Test results summary.
   - Any failures or errors.
   - Link to a detailed report.
```

[NOTE]

Tests will only run after explicit confirmation to ensure the script is ready for execution.

=== Q: How to set up recursive updates of steps by AI?

[IMPORTANT]

Please be aware of token limits. Send only the relevant story (add context).

Due to token limitations, break down large test suites:

*  Update scenarios in small batches (3-5 at a time).
*  Use intermediate commits.
*  Request focused updates.

Prompt example to add recursive test scenarios update:

```
Update test scenarios to include enhanced logging and error handling, focusing on the login flow 
```

=== Q: How to combine several cases written by AI in different files?

Combining Strategies:

*  Extract common steps to separate scenario.
*  Create composite steps.
*  Use story includes.

Prompt example for file combination:

```
Combine these test scenarios into a single story file, extract common steps into separate scenario, and create composite steps for repeated actions.
```

=== Q: How to refactor existing code with AI help? 

[IMPORTANT]

Please be aware of token limits. If you need a full refactor, split the work into multiple passes.

Refactoring Approaches:

*  Share existing code with AI (add context).
*  Request specific improvements.
*  Apply design patterns.

=== Q: What to do when AI starts hallucinating after previously working well?

**Symptoms:**

*  Generated steps don't match Vividus step list.
*  Incorrect locator formats (not using id/xpath as specified).
*  Invalid syntax or made-up parameters.
*  Attempts to execute non-existent commands.
*  Creates invalid file structures.

Immediate Actions:

.  Stop current generation.
.  Clear the conversation.
.  Start fresh with URL and requirements (use `test-template.prompt.md` or provide details in chat).
